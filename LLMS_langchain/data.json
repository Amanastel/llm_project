    "Question: What is your child watching in cartoon time?\nAnswer: Whenever I get irritated at my daughter, I remember this incident.\nWhen she was three or four years old, we used to go to the garden and it had a swing. So she used to ask me to push her on the swing. I used to do it for 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, and half an hour, now how long will a person keep on pushing the swing? So I used to get irritated. \n\nA year and a half passed, and she grew up. We went back to the garden. Now, her feet were touching the ground and she was able to push the swing by herself. And then she said, \"Dad, see I can do this by myself!\" Then I realised that she doesn't need my help to swing. I realised how quickly my daughter is growing up. \n\nHow quickly do children grow up? And I made a promise to myself that whatever moments I get with her, I will try to cherish them.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CmQjO2YqbYl/",
    "Question: Getting irritated with your child? (Swing)\nAnswer: I was recently in this parenting course, and one of the things was to observe your children after the course.\n\nAnd what happened was this mother sent this wonderful incident that she saw her child throwing his cycle again and again down the slope. And her first instinct was to stop him. It will break. Don't do this. But she did not. And after 10, or 15 tries, the child came to the mother and said, mom, my friend's cycle does not turn when it is thrown down the slope, but my cycle is turning.\n\nWhy is this? And the mom realized that there was a meaning to the child's action. The child was trying to do something. So they discussed for a few more minutes and made progress. I'm sharing this because whenever a child does something, it always has some meaning. Can we have patience? Can I have the patience to observe and not react and see what happens?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CmqKfieBTdT/",
    "Question: Why was the child throwing cycle down the slope?\nAnswer: But mom, I want to play football!\n\nThis wonderful conversation happened between my friend and her 8-year-old son.\n\nHer son had just joined football in the evening and after office, she also went to see what is he up to. And she saw, he was horrible like he doesn't know how to play well.  Even in the warmup, he's one round behind everybody else. So when the game finished and he came, she said, dear, do you want to join swimming? And he was puzzled. He said, mom, why? Uh, I already know swimming.\n\nI don't know football. I want to learn football. And my friend was telling me that is when she realized that it was she who was being protective as a mother. She was putting her mindset on the child. And we don't need to do that. We don't need to protect our children all the time. We can just let them be and we can let them grow.\n\nURL: ",
    "Question: But mom, I want to play football - Forcing mindset\nAnswer: I saw an incident of a mother lying to the child\n\nI had gone to drop my daughter to school. And this other parent was trying to get her son out of the car so that she could drop him. Woh aa hi nahin raha tha. So she said, ‘see see bus came’ So he poked out a little and she grabbed him. Obviously there was no bus. But the task of the mother was done. To deposit the kid at the gate of the school. \n\nThere are many incidents like this which occur daily. For e.g. your child could ask mom I want candy. And you could say beta finish ho gayi. But the child knows it is there in the house. \n\nThe question I think about is: isn’t losing the ‘trust of our child’ too big a cost to pay for ‘getting work done’\n\nThe truth could be harder to say but it does preserve and improve our relationship with our child. \n\nAnd the child will learn that to get what one wants, it is not required to lie.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CnOzvk0BO1l/",
    "Question: How often do we lie to our child?\nAnswer: Kids around the age of 6 and 7 suddenly start to look big. When that happens our expectations as parents also grow. For them to be more mature. More adult like. \n\nBut I read these great lines about 6-7 year old children \n\n\"The top front milk teeth have fallen out, but the new second teeth which will last a lifetime are not quite fully formed. So there are gaps which are yet to be filled. \n\nSame is the case with the child at an emotional level. Infancy has been left behind but adulthood is still a long way off. In between, there is a lot of learning to do. The child is looking bigger but emotionally, brain wise, there is a long way to go. \n\nAnd more than ever this child needs our love and understanding. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CnT9fqQBr0Z/",
    "Question: Understanding 6-7 years old\nAnswer: If you eat your food you can watch cartoon.\nIf you finish your homework you can play with friends.\nIf you don’t stop crying Mumma will go away. This is managing using reward or fear. Generally used wherever there is a power equation. Yeh karoge to yeh milega. Yeh nahin karoge to yeh nahin milega. \n\nThis is used a lot with kids.\n\nWhat I think about is that to get a child to eat which is a necessity of life should we need a reward? Or to get a child to control their emotion, to stop crying, should we need a threat? \n\nOr is it just that we do this because as adults this is what we have seen as children aur phir office mein bhi aisa hi hota hai. And that once we realise that there is another way, can we stop using reward and threats to raise our children?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cng247nMAYF/",
    "Question: If you do___you can___\nAnswer: When I found out that in Maharashtra kids had to be 6 years old to be admitted to first class, I was furious.  I was like, my child is bright. If she can do it then why can’t she be in first class. Who is the state to decide? \n\nSo I did some research.\n\nThe short answer seems to be that by the age of 6 the brain of the kids develops enough to take instructions, to coordinate and to play with others in a group. Hence the child becomes fit for education in the traditional sense.\n\nBut the broader question is: why did I want to send my child to school early? Why this rush? Because if you really see a child is a learning machine from the time of birth. The first 6 years are highly impressionable and the need is not to learn Maths and English early but to be able to play freely. To be able to follow their sense of agency to choose a task like collecting stones or stacking bricks or and do it without external praise or reward. \n\nFrom this freedom comes the discipline to learn later. \n\nSo actually changing of age is great and we should be thankful our kids are not going to school earlier.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CnmIjJuhKso/",
    "Question: Why age restriction of 6 years to be in 1st class?\nAnswer: My daughter's school has no formal homework given for vacations.\n\nSo my wife Bhakti was surprised when Diya came to her today morning with a pen and copy and said: Give me homework. So my wife asked ‘Why?’. And she said All my friends are doing it. I also want to do. So she got Bhakti to make up questions for English and Mathematics and happily went away to her friend's house to solve together. What I learnt from this was that the company of peers, the environment matters more than we give it credit for. The may be parents matter much less than what we want to take credit for.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CnoxgkXBCN9/",
    "Question: Give me homework\nAnswer: # “Do not ask your childrento strive for extraordinary lives.Such striving may seem admirable,but it is the way of foolishness.Help them instead to find the wonderand the marvel of an ordinary life.Show them the joy of tastingtomatoes, apples and pears.Show them how to crywhen pets and people die.Show them the infinite pleasurein the touch of a hand.And make the ordinary come alive for them.The extraordinary will take care of itself.”\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cny6NfGSUh8/",
    "Question: Don't strive\nAnswer: Many parents with teenage kids complain about mobile addiction. So what can you do? Let’s see from a story. World famous author Glennnon Doyle wrote in her book Untamed that when his son turned 13, she gifted him a mobile. And she says that in the next 2 years I saw how my son became a different person. Someone who used to write poems, go outside to play was now lost in an online world.  Why does this story matter? What is the crux? \n\nOne is that if you are the parent of a teenager struggling with this, you need to take this walk now.\n\nThe crux for me was that I hope that while my child is young I put in the effort so that I can have a relationship  where tomorrow she is willing to go on a walk with me.\n\n\n\nThis is when she decided to take a walk with him. And in that walk she said to him, I have always tried to do the right thing for you. But I feel that by you having a phone I have done a wrong thing. And I am afraid to ask to take it back because all of your friends have it. So I wonder what to do?\n\nHis son was quiet for a while and then he said. Mom I have heard lot of kids are going into depression because of mobiles and lot of artists are giving up mobile so that they can concentrate on their work. \nWhy does this story matter? What is the crux? \n\nOne is that if you are the parent of a teenager struggling with this, you need to take this walk now.\n\nThe crux for me was that I hope that while my child is young I put in the effort so that I can have a relationship  where tomorrow she is willing to go on a walk with me.\n\n\nThey walked more together and decided to give up social media. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn1fDwnorv9/",
    "Question: Mobile Addiction in Teenagers\nAnswer: There seem to be different kind of children in this world. Stubborn, easy going, angry, shouting, naughty. Some children who like playing outdoors, some who want to be indoors, some who make a tantrum out of nothing, some who share everything. \n\nSo are there really many kinds of children in this world?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nI think there is only one kind of child in this world. A child absorbed in doing something without need of praise, reward or fear.\n\nBecause when a child finds something that interests her everything else vanishes. There are no tantrums, no anger. What remains is only a child absorbed in work.But this child is vanishing from earth. Why? Because of distractions. From mobile to cartoon to toys to hobby classes so many things to do. Our world has become too noisy. \n\nIf you ask me other than giving love our main job as a parent is to let the child discover this ONE CHILD without letting the world distract.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn4Dw1UItHw/",
    "Question: One kind of child\nAnswer: \"We don't teach Indian history. It's not part of the curriculum\" This was the response of the international school. My friend had approached the Mumbai school to check when her daughter will start to learn about Marathas. And the school said ‘hum parathe hi nahin hai’ \n\nI was surprised. \n\nI have nothing against international schools. I do think the way of teaching in international curriculum is better than rote learning in most state boards or CBSE. \n\nBut think of it from the perspective of a child living in Mumbai. This child will be seeing forts of Shivaji around Mumbai, see roads and monuments named after Indian historical figures but instead of Maratha Wars will be learning about American Revolution.\n\nBut a child does not learn from kitaabi concepts - from knowing about American history without being there in that culture. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CoE7wM4yFWR/",
    "Question: Indian school does not teach Indian history\nAnswer: Unfavorable environment affects children. And it is important for parents to interfere. My wife had to go to London for a few days for her office work. And she was showing me how much she walked. About 15000 steps every day. London is more of a walking city, you go down, you walk to the train station, you get out of train, you walk to office. You walk down for lunch etc.  But in India going to office she walks less than 5000 steps a day. So this is a place where our role as a parent requires us to interfere. And a good way to interfere is by having simple rules like: from 5-7 in the evening we will go down to play.\n\nSimple rules prevent a power struggle with the child. And also  ensure that even though the environment is not favorable your child gets the physical activity required to stay healthy.\n\nThis is the affect of the environment.\n\nChildren can’t reason like this. They can’t say ohh I am living in an apartment in India so I not getting enough outdoor time. But it is a fact that living in a city apartment reduces physical activity of the child. In an apartment complex kids will continue to just play in a room or watch screen. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CoHmNjTv_Cj/",
    "Question: Parent interference is important. But where?\nAnswer: What is parenting? If you see it is actually interference in child’s life. For most of us our parents still do it - calling us, asking us questions, telling us what is ok, not ok. This is interference. And I don’t mean this is a negative way. Just as a fact.\n\nSo if we see our child is eating too much candy, we interfere.\n\nIf we see our child is watching too much TV, we interfere.\n\nIf we feel that our child’s friends are not right, we interfere.\n\nSo if we interfere, if we try to parent, it is normal for a child to respond back, to not be ok with the interference. \n\nSo the key thing becomes: ‘how to interfere’ and the answer to that is simple. In most cases this interference is best done through a set of simple rules like\n- We will eat 1 candy/day only\n- Cartoon time is 30 min everyday\n- Dinner time is 7:00 pm.\n\nSimple rules like these are easy for children to follow and make parenting easier for the parent.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CoKJWfpy-Xq/",
    "Question: What is parenting?\nAnswer: Making this simple change changed my relationship with my daughter. And this I think works for wives and husbands as well. When my daughter wanted to go to the washroom she would ask us to stand there, not go anywhere. To stay next to her. We would argue why, that this is not ok, we would explain we have work, some crying will happen. But a lot of times we just had to stand.\n\nThen I tried a simple thing 2 weeks back. When she was going to the washroom and called me I gave her a warm hug. I said to her, Dadda is here, ok. \n\nThat day she did not ask me to stand outside. This I learnt is connection over correction. We are too quick point out to the child what is the correct way or behavior and then get into an argument or a power struggle. \n\nWhereas the thing that is missing is just connection. That is what the child is missing. She is not connecting with you unless you are in sight. \n\nMaking that connection is the key bit. Sometimes it is with a hug, sometimes with a smile, sometimes with our undivided attention to what they are saying. \n\nAnd this actually is useful with adults and children both.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CoUYhfqoGuj/",
    "Question: Connection before correction\nAnswer: When do friends start impacting our child? My friends daughter is 5 years old and scared of animals. Or so the parents thought based on what they had seen. All the trips they have done to petting zoos, farms she would be scared. Big reaction to spiders and ants at home. Nothing helped.\n\nThen a month ago three families went on a camping trip together. 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old. And we parents were doing their own thing when my friends noticed their daughter in the petting zoo feeding ducks, playing with rabbits and then going for a horse ride together. Impact of friends company can be positive or negative. But earlier I used to think of the concept of ‘company of friends’ as applied to teenagers and above. It has taken this incident for me to understand that this starts really early. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CoXBW2Eo-QO/",
    "Question: When do friends start impacting our child?\nAnswer: \"Dadda, do you know the F word?\"\nYesterday night just before dozing off, my daughter asked me this. I said: which word beta? There are lot of words from the letter F.\nShe said: Dadda, the one which also has this sign (gingerly showing me the middle finger). I can't say it. You shouldn't say it. hmmm let me spell it f u c k\nMe: I have heard it, yes. How did you hear it?\nDaughter: I heard it in school. My FriendA told me this sign and then asked me to show it to FriendB. But he got upset and went and told the teacher.\nMe: then what happened\nDaughter: teacher called me and she asked me - how did I hear this word. I told her FriendA told me.\nMe: then?\nDaughter: teacher called FriendA. FriendA told her that FriendC told her this.\nMe: then?\nDaughter: So teacher called FriendC and spoke to her. Teacher said we should not use this word.\nMe: ya, I agree. Other people may not like it.\nDaughter: dadda, can I say this word once.\nMe: ok, say it.\nShe said it and then happily conked off to sleep. It has taken me a lot of time and effort to realize that the problem is in the adults head. And for kids things seem to be simple as long as adults don’t make a big thing about it. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CoZj5yFoUoI/",
    "Question:  The F word\nAnswer: Our brains don’t have a place to read and write. This is why children reverse letters. \n\nNot because they are idiots who can’t understand a simple thing like this. Human brain has been evolving for 2 million years. So our brain has a place for object identification which means that a cup should remain a cup no matter if it is ulta phulta. A scissor should be a scissor no matter how it is kept. \n\nBut alphabets don’t behave that way. b ko ulta karo do d ban jaata hai. And because reading and writing are only 5000 years old so our brain hasn’t adapted to accommodate this. This is the reason children reverse letters. By the age of 8 an area called VWFA Visual Word Form Area is automatically created as the child is exposed to reading and writing. \n\nIn 99% cases you don’t need to worry if your child reverses letters. There is no need to correct. It will self correct. As is actually the case with most things that our children do :-) \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CocJeDXvxjg/",
    "Question: Why do children reverse letters?\nAnswer: Do we as parents ever get to see your real child? We were on a vacation together and my friend saw his 5 year old daughter eating junk food. So he was a little bit angry with her and told her not to eat more junk food. She said, yes dad. I will not eat. \n\nBut in the evening he again saw her eating junk but as he approached she tried hiding it from him. \n\nThis is when my friend realized what his approach had done. It had only created a child which was different in front of the parent. He no longer was seeing his real child but only a version of it.  Researcher Judith Harris in her book The Nurture Assumption says that parents never get to see their real children. The real children come out in front of friends, in front of people who don’t judge them where they are not afraid. And in front of parents we only see a made up version of our child. Never our real one.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CohQXUQrSOk/",
    "Question: Two personalities of children\nAnswer: Here is the one important thing that parents miss when picking a school. Two years ago when we had to pick a school for my daughter, my wife went for a school admission talk. She had gone in an auto and as she got down, she saw a lot of BMWs and Audis coming and parents getting down, with Gucci bags.\n\nAnd she called me and said, I don't want my daughter to go to this school. We later found out in one of the birthday parties, iPads were given as return gifts. So you know, when we go and look for a school, we look at the distance from the house and we ask all the right questions to the school. For example, the quality of teachers.\n\nWhat is the education of the teachers? What kind of food will be given in school? How much outdoors time do they get? Or extracurricular activities? We ask all these, but we forget the one thing that matters a lot. Who will my child go to school with? Who are the peers? Because children don't only learn from teachers and classrooms.\n\nThey pick the habits and characteristics of who they study with. And they play a large part on what the child becomes.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CorlbF6IaMz/",
    "Question: One important thing that parents miss when picking a school\nAnswer: My daughter likes playing ludo with my parents. And they often let her win. So I was surprised when my dad called me one day and said that I think I am not doing the right thing by letting her win. Because then how will she learn to lose? Because life will throw a lot of losses her way and if she is accustomed to winning, this can become a habit leading today to tantrums and tomorrow to behavioral problems. Also he said her dependence on external motivation will increase. I personally think he is right. He is also right because it is important for children to learn that the journey is more important than the destination. Her joy has to come from playing a game of ludo with her grand parents, not from the final outcome. That the journey is more imp than the destination.\n\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CouMtTlL27X/",
    "Question: Should we let kids win?\nAnswer: I have a question for you. Today morning I got in the lift and there was a kid with his father. Dressed up to go to school. I know both of them. So we smiled and the lift started to go down.\nI said hello and asked the kid: Hey which school do you go to?\nThe father waited a second and then replied: Nahar International\nMy floor came and I stepped out and said: bye bye\nThe father waited a second and said: say bye to uncle. I have been guilty of replying on behalf of my kid many times. Before I realized I shouldn't be doing it.\n\nBut why do you think that we as parents feel the need to reply on behalf of their kids? What do you think?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Co4baXyoRC0/",
    "Question: ‘Question for parents’\nWhy do we reply?\nAnswer: Living in a joint family can be tough. My friend noticed that her child had started hitting. And she was quick to notice why. It was because of Hanuman. So she wanted to stop it. But it was not easy :-) Why? Because she lives in a joint family. And seeing Hanuman had been started by her mother in law. My friend goes to office so peechey se she had almost no control. And this frustrated her. \n\nShe tried talking to her mother in law, father in law. But their input was that this phase will go away, why stop a religious cartoon? Her husband for good reason did not want to come in between mom and wife. This is a constant struggle in joint families. Everyone has different views. This is not a question of right or wrong but of being cognizant that in a joint family there are multiple parents. \n\nAnd the key to healthy parenting can only lie in having a good relationship with the other members in the family. And using that to do what is right for the child. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Co7CvllIXwy/",
    "Question: Living in a joint family\nAnswer: If we want to talk about choosing a pre-school then the important question is what do kids do in pre-school? Karte kya hai. \nA good way to know this is to look at entrance exams for Class 1. So I did that and I want you to judge how much time a child needs to learn to clear that exam? Let's look at the syllabus together:\nMaths - numbers till 100. Before and after. Single digit addition subtraction\nEnglish - alphabets, vowels, spellings of fruits, colours, animals, numbers etc\nOther things like shapes, identification of objects, counting of objects\n\nSo how much time does a child need to know abcd, 1234, cat, dog, rectangle? A month may be if you as a parent spend say 2 hours a day with them?\n\nBut a child goes to pre-school for 3-4 years before class 1. LKG, UKG are standards where we send our kids for 4-5  hours a day to learn. Now as a parent when I hear this it is clear to me that a child goes to pre-school, LKG, UKG not because there is study to be done but because parents want some company for the child and some free time for themselves. \n\nAlso it is clear to me that what is not imp for this pre-school or LKG/UKG is what they teach because that's almost nothing to teach but may be how they teach. Do they make him sit on a seat or do they let a child explore, do they say you have to learn this or do they let a child pick something that the child wants to learn? Does the pre-school let the child be himself and follow his sense of agency. That is important.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpAKPVfrlVd/",
    "Question: How to choose a preschool?\nAnswer: It was cold. And we were about to go to school on a scooter. My 7 year old daughter was wearing only a thin spaghetti. I knew she will feel cold so I asked her to wear her jacket. She said no. I said then sit behind me: She said no. \n\nI said ok. She stood in the front and we started driving. In 5 sec I could see that she is feeling cold. So I asked her: beta do you want to go and sit behind? She said yes. So I stopped and she climbed back to sit.\n\nThe next day we were again going to school when I realized that she is again wearing a spaghetti. I was like, she isn’t learning. But when we started the scooter, she straightaway climbed back. Something that made me a little proud.A day before I could have said to her. You have to wear your jacket. Or that you have to sit behind. Because I am saying it is cold. You cannot stand in the front. She might have agreed physically but her mind would still have revolted. \n\nBut letting her learn by herself changed that. And this learning will stay with her forever because it is self learnt. And because her mind is aligned with the action she is taking. She is not doing something because a parent has asked her to but because she believes so it is the right thing to do. This is the kind of learning we should try and enable for our children. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpKetxTogKe/",
    "Question: Can children learn by themselves?\nAnswer: I have too many dms asking about which school is best for my child?  Where should I take admission? The truth is, I don't know. The reason for that is it depends on, as a parent, what outcome we want for our children. Many parents feel that they want their child to clear competitive exams. And hence they put their children in state board, CBSE or ICSE.\n\nA lot of parents want their children to go abroad, or they want their children to understand why things work rather than rote learning, or knowing what of things. And these children then end up going to international curriculums. I personally feel that a young child should be able to pursue their sense of agency, be able to pick work that they enjoy doing. So my daughter goes to a Montessori school. And Montessori and Waldorf are good examples of such schools where a child is free to pick what they want. The environment defines the child and parents define the environment. So there is no one answer to which school is best for the child.\n\nIt depends on what as a parent we want for our children.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpNCRptolTp/",
    "Question: What school is best for my child\nAnswer: \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpPpfXkok6H/",
    "Question: Idher aao, come here!\nAnswer: My daughter sees cartoon for 30 minutes a day. And the moment she steps off the school bus, she wanted to rush and go and see the cartoon. So I'll be there to pick her up, but she'll rush, go up, start watching the cartoon. Like it'll be in her mind. And over a period of 2-3 months, I started to feel like a loss of connection.\n\nI don't know if she felt it or not. I felt it. So I spoke to her and I said, look, I know you want to watch cartoon and your 30 minutes are there. But I feel we are not getting to talk at all once you come back from school. So let's make a rule that will start cartoon at 2:00 PM. She protested a little but agreed.\n\nAnd this simple change in rule has made so much difference. Now when she gets off the bus, she will walk with me. We'll walk together, we'll talk a little bit. She'll tell me a little bit about the school, and we'll go up. You know, she'll eat a little bit food. We'll have 5-10 minutes to play before 2:00 PM is there, and then she goes on to watch her cartoon.\n\nBut making this simple change has made me feel more connected to my child.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpUv4luIUZE/",
    "Question: Small changes make a difference\nAnswer: I was talking to a mother who's just had her second child.  And this mother has the most beautiful observations about her children, and she told me something, which I think is at the crux of parenting. She said that when she had her first son, she started watching videos online, started following influencers.\n\nAnd buying things and she's always felt overwhelmed. You know, she bought one book, then another book, one toy, another toy, and soon the house was full of toys and books. But it did not feel enough and she did not want to feel this way. And she said, when I had my second child, I decided to stop all of this. And she stopped.\n\nStopped buying books, stopped buying toys. And she said, the only thing I've started doing is observing my children. And this observing without interference, she said is hard. But it seems to have brought her more peace than any of the other things that she did earlier could. This I think, is at the crux of parenting, and I think it is the simplest way for a parent to not feel overwhelmed that can we be with our children and only observe them without actually interfering?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpceidloZsF/",
    "Question: Observation > interference\nAnswer: My daughter recently got fascinated with Pokeman cards. We were visiting my parents house and she went to buy a pack with her cousin brother. When she came back she told me: you know dadda I got the card I wanted in the pack. You know why?\n\nI asked: why beta?\n\nAnd she said: because dadda I prayed to God before buying it. \n\nI don’t believe in God so I asked her, where did you learn this. And she said: Daadi :-) and went off to sleep. And so I once again realised that every interaction with the child creates an impression. And we can’t control everything, definitely not our mothers😛\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpfDCqntn_X/",
    "Question: God helped me get Pokeman\nAnswer: My friend's son was sent home from three schools. The first school sent him after one day, and the other two schools sent him home after a week. And he's six years old. And the school's complaint was 'your child can't sit at a place and study.' So my friend's instinct was to teach him at home so that I can get him to study. And then a relative advised him this, a relative who had seen and he heard about this and he said, I've seen, I've noticed that whenever you go out of the house.\n\nAnd you go out very often, you always hold your son's hand. You know, you never let him go away. And the relatives suggested they changed that. And they changed it. They let him be. They overcame the risk that something will happen to him or he will get lost. And they let him be. They left his hand and over one month the child now goes to the school and he is able to sit down and he is able to study. So why is that? The reason for this is that our brains get formed through movement.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CphmjCsoFy5/",
    "Question: More free time over studies\nAnswer: I was dropping Diya at her friend's place when we stopped to drink coconut water. As the coconut water guy gave us coconuts, we started to drink. And I looked towards Diya to talk to her about something. But then I stopped. As I saw her lost in observing the coconut guy working. She was deeply observing, lost in it. And even a year or so ago, I wouldn’t have stopped, I would have interrupted her concentration and started talking about something else, there was a plane passing by with a jet stream, and I would have pointed her to it. But now that her natural concentration was somewhere else, I let her be. And after about a min or two she turned and we started chatting about something else. \n\nHere is what I tell do before calling my child: I pause for a moment, Can you starting today consciously pause a moment before you call your child’s name? \n\nIf you do, please do share incidents where you stopped and paused and didn’t interrupt your child.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpkPSZ9vNJe/",

    "Question: Has behaviour of your child changed?\nAnswer: My friend shared this incident with me which she saw in her apartment. \n\nThere was an 8 year old who doesn’t like to do homework. His mother was compelling him to do it. He went outside via back door and hid somewhere. His mother opened the back door and then he ran to the front. His grandfather opened the front door and he ran to the other side. His grandfather went after him and took him inside his home.\n\nAnd she wrote to me that as she was witnessing this she was wondering till when parents would force the child to do homework or to study? And she was wondering what would happen if the parents let the child go to school without doing the homework? Wouldn’t it be better if the child was allowed to face the consequences himself? And then decide himself what to do? \n\nAs I saw her message I was reminded of one thing that I am sure. This is something I have learnt in my own life and then validated with research and that is: **Discipline comes through freedom.** It comes from within. From the feeling I want to do this. Not from ‘you have to do this’. \n\nNobody likes that and it never works in the long run. \n\nAfter all how long can we keep running behind our children asking them to finish their homework?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpxFZn2o9ne/",
    "Question: Finish your homework\nAnswer: Arey beti ko bhej do, mein bachon ko time zone leke jaa raha hoon. My friend said.\n\nTime zone is a video game parlour in malls where kids generally have a lot of fun. \n\nBut I said no. \n\nTill a few months ago, I would have thought. Hey, it’s ok. My daughter and her daughter are friends. They will have a good time together and come back. \n\nBut as a family we are consciously trying to remove distractions. \n\nOur cities are full of life. So full of life that they don’t sleep at night. It is in these cities that we have to protect our child’s brain from feeling rushed all the time. \n\nOur child’s brain is constantly stimulated. \n\nAnd may be because we lack time for our kids, out of guilt we want to take the child out for an ice cream or to the mall, where we see them having maximum fun. But this fun can be dangerous in the long run. \n\nSo can we stop doing that?\n\nCan we slow down the pace of life for our child?\nCan we instead of going to time zone, just go down for a walk in the park?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpzrKySI3_Z/",
    "Question: Slowing down for our kids\nAnswer: After vacation a friends son was upset. In summer this particular family went on vacation to US with his family. They came back and school started. When his son came back from the school he was visibly upset. When the father probed, he said my friends went business class in vacation, only we went economy. They were talking about how they slept in the flight. My vacation does not even seem like a vacation. And the father was in a shock. And I was thinking why does this happen? Does this happen because in some homes we are constantly comparing ourselves unknowingly, our clothes, cars, size of the house, our careers, and kids catch on to it subconsciously?\n\nOr is it because we have compared our child earlier to other children - we have said to him, see how well dressed the other child is, or see how good piano he is playing, or he knows maths, why can't you do sums? \n\nChildren are impacted by peers. So I was thinking what can parents do in a situation like this? When I thought of this I remember a poem that my father taught me.  He used to tell me to say to yourself\nDay by day\nIn every way\nI am becoming\nbetter and better.\n\nAnd this is a poem that I sometimes sing with my daughter. \n\nThe idea is to tell her that comparison is ok, but only with yourself. That it doesn't matter how good or bad your friend plays basketball, are you better at basketball today than you were at it yesterday?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp40GHBI7uv/",
    "Question: Sharma ji ka beta\nAnswer: Our kids have ‘new’ things all the time. A relative shared with me how when she was young and wanted to learn knitting, they didn't have needles so she learned it using jharoo ke teele. She had to get creative because she really wanted to learn.  \n\nAnd as I was listening I was wondering if we are today too quick to give new things to our children?\n \nBecause getting new things can make the old boring for them. And this prevents deeper interaction with what they already have. And most learning happens through this deep interaction. Ads everywhere are telling us to buy. What we need to understand is that having a new thing is not what is required for a child to be happy. A lot of satisfaction can come from interacting deeply and creatively with the old.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp998RJIQiv/",
    "Question: NEW NEW\nAnswer: Are you worried about your child having speech delay? The first thing I want to tell you is that in 99% cases, there is nothing for you to worry about at all. \n\nAnd here is the number 1 way to solve it. \nReduce cartoon time. I have now spoken to, chatted with multiple parents who wrote about speech delay for their child and in 80% cases the reason seems to be 2-3 hours of cartoon time a day. \n\nThe second biggest reason is that the parents are busy and we are not talking to our child enough. Not smiling, looking into the eyes and engaging with the child. We are changing nappies by showing them mobile and not talking to them.\n\nSo the key reason for speech delay is lack of practice for the child. These 2 things i.e. cartoon time of <30 min a day and talking to the child, if done well will ensure that speech delay will vanish. And the child will start speaking in less than two months.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqAjLuesyId/",
    "Question: Are you worried about your child having speech delay?\nAnswer: Have you seen ducklings walking behind a duck in a line? \n\nHave you wondered why that happens or why they do that? The reason is imprinting. When a duckling hatches from the egg, the first moving thing it sees, it imprints upon. This happens because a duck cannot go around chasing 10 ducklings so nature has found this way to ensure the children of the duck stay in line. \n\nAnd it doesn’t change just because humans have started keeping ducks. The ducklings continue to imprint on whoever they see first. So if instead of the mother, the duckling sees you, it will imprint on you and follow you around. This is what millions of years of evolution has done. \n\nWhy am I sharing this? Because a similar thing is programmed into new born babies. \n\nThey are born for love. For millions of years after giving birth the child has remained in the lap of the mother 24*7, all the time. \n\nAnd this is the expectation of the new born baby even today. The expectation is not a nice looking cot with some ducks hanging on the side of it. The expectation is of a warm body and to listen to the heartbeat of someone all the time.\n\nAnd when this is not met, when secure attachment in the first couple of years does not happen is when we have children who feel insecure, anxious, who want to stay close to parents later, who get angry, just because in the first two years they haven’t gotten what nature wanted them to get.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqDIWazI7jo/",
    "Question: Have you seen ducklings walking behind a duck in a line? \nAnswer: There was a group where we were discussing ‘how tribal children are raised’. And someone asked, what do young tribal children do about poop? Because young children have a habit of picking anything to taste, or bite, isn't that a problem? A person who has been staying with tribal people sent this beautiful reply: he said tribal children learn to walk at age of 7 months which is earlier than city children. And around them they are able to see what dogs, cats, hens, camels, donkeys, cows are doing with their poop so they do the same. They automatically without teaching put soil, sticks over their poop and walk away. The idea is just to share that young children learn by observation. And this observation can be of humans or of animals. \n\nMost of human inventions have been because of such observations: our first airplane designs came from birds. In 1889 Otto published the book called Birdflight which became the basis of aviation. \n\nJust that we forget this when we start teaching our children by talking instead of letting them observe.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqFrnKcNZre/",
    "Question: Learning from tribal children\nAnswer: My aunt shared this incident from her childhood. That her first introduction to art was through her cousins who she only met on summer vacations. And that they are the ones who taught her how to knit, how to embroider and that simple thing has gone on to become her life’s work. And she became a professor of Art. \n\nAnd this happened because there was this period of summer vacations where they could be at a place with their cousins without the need to travel or school or go visit one place or another and just play and learn new things. It was a new environment that she was exposed to for a long enough time.\n\nI saw the same thing when we went on a beach holiday. And on day 1 the children were afraid of the small white crabs. On day 2, they were still afraid. On day 3 they were more curious watching them run around and on Day 4 they were chasing the crabs.\n\nThis wouldn’t have been possible if we were not staying at the same place the whole time.  If we had kept traveling to new places every day, then this kind of relationship wouldn’t have developed.\n\nSo as we choose our travel for summer vacations, this is one thing we could keep in mind. \n\nTo travel more slowly and allow a deeper interaction for our children with the world around them.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqK2zQaLYmF/",
    "Question: Planning for summer vacations\nAnswer: What does fuck mean?\nFuck means sex. But many people don't like hearing this word.\nBut what does sex mean?\nSex is how animals and humans have babies\nWhat is this?\nIt is called a penis\nHe said I am gay and laughed. What is gay?\nSometimes men fall in love with men and women fall in love with women. We call it a 'Gay' relationship. These are normal questions not different from any other 'what is this' question by kids. There is no difference for the child between a finger and a vagina. The difference is in our heads.\n\nAnd if we can remember simple definitions of what these words mean, we can answer them normally. But if we feel embarrassed, or \nif we hush the question, and \nwe tell them to not ask such questions \nthe more curious they will become. \n\nAnd they will find out, just that the next time they won't ask you.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqSjJD-IIEB/",
    "Question: Fcuk Sex Penis Gay\nAnswer: Someone asked me: what do you think is the number 1 mistake dad’s make? I think the number 1 mistake dad’s make is to think that they will bond with the child when he or she is older. When they can go out to play a sport with them, take them to a cricket match or discuss big things with them. Do things that they generally do with friends. That they will become friends once the child is older. And so they spend less time with the young child. \n\nAnd that simple mistake can be very painful later on. \n\nThe only way to learn is from fathers who have made this mistake. And their learning is: if you don’t bond early, forming a bond later is very tough. And the child does not want to spend time with you. It feels like you just don’t know each other. So if you are a dad waiting for your child to grow up, DON’T wait. The time to spend time with your child is now, when the child is young and wants to be with you.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVFfj0I6aq/",
    "Question: Number 1 mistake dads make\nAnswer: Here is a solution we have found to eat less chocolate. My daughter's friend came home to play. She stayed for 5-6 hours, in between the kids changed clothes, so she wore my daughter's clothes, and went home in them. \n\nHer parents are wonderful people - thoughtful and kind. When they sent back the clothes with a thank you note they also sent a big chocolate. \n\nSo I called them and said, that I know you sent the chocolate with a lot of love, but we will give this chocolate away to the guards in the building or someone else, because we are trying to consume less junk food. While dairy milk has become etched in our mind with happiness but at the end of the day it's sugar. \n\nIf we have chocolates at home, even I can't control so there is no way I can ask my daughter to control. So the only way is to not gift anyone a chocolate yourself and if someone gifts, give it away. That is the one solution that we have found to eat less chocolates and sugar.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqXs0fgooZP/",
    "Question: Solution for eating less chocolate\nAnswer: My friends daughter has got into the habit of saying 'whatever'. She is 7 years old and if you for e.g. say hi how are you, she's like whatever, or can you get this from the room, she's like whatever. And I was like where did she pick this from? And it suddenly dawned on me that her father uses the word a lot. And over time it's just got transferred to her as a habit. \n\nHe didn't say to her, 'Beta, you have to learn to say whatever'. But she just picked it up. And now her saying ‘whatever’ triggers adults. \n\nSo what do we do. \n\nOne way to react to this is to say: stop saying, I don't like it. But that will only aggravate the behavior. So the way to deal with it is either not to react \nOR \nto react with love and play. \n\nLike if you say something and she says whatever, you can tickle her and say aacha whatever, hmm whatever I will not stop tickling you till you are saying whatever and suddenly a tense situation becomes a light one and the entire thing will pass in a month.\n\nOr if you hit the child, she might not speak it in front of you but it will remain inside her. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqc0uY2ID1U/",
    "Question: Picking habits from parents\nAnswer: Shhh don’t make noise. She will wake up.\nWhen my daughter was born I used to say this all the time to my parents, my in-laws, ke shor mat karo meri beti uth jayegi. And they used to tell me I am being very sensitive. And I used to get angry with them. Ke itni si baat unko samaj mein nahin aati ke bacha aawaaz se uth jaata hai? Turns out they were right. Bacha aawaaz se uth jaata hai, lekin isliye kyonki usko humne akela ek jagah pe sone ke liye rakh diya hai. The real reason is not the sound but that the child is alone. And that is not how evolution has been. \n\nFor millions of years the new born kid has always been with the mother in body to body touch till the child learned how to crawl. Whether mother went to a gathering which had music, whether she was cooking, walking sleeping. The child was with the mother. \n\nAnd this is the pre programmed expectation that the child is born with.And the silent room, the lack of sound is not what the child needs to grow. What the child wants to hear is the heartbeat and activity of her mother. That is the need of a baby. It is born for love.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqkhhPkNI3L/",
    "Question: Born for love\nAnswer: We were always getting late for school. The same thing: khana khao, taiyaar ho jao, kapre pehno, chalo late ho raha hai. \n\nSo here’s what we did. We talked to our 7 year old daughter and said. We will wake you and we will be there to help you if you need help. But you have to get ready on time, dress up, eat what you want to eat. And if we get late, you can just be at home. That’s ok. \n\nAnd this changed everything. We still have to remind her about time because she can get lost in a book but that’s about it. The rest has reversed, she’s like - dadda you are not ready to go, we will get late. Try this in your house. And if they are lazy and get late to school let them be at home without screen, let them get absolutely bored.\n\nAll of us have a sense of agency. The need to be in control of the outcome of their life. This is the most basic human need. And we can help fulfil it from childhood by giving control to our children\n\nAnd also reducing our stress in life.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqnIRSJv5VZ/",
    "Question: How to get ready for school on time\nAnswer: Why do we buy things for our kids? Because they need them or because we need them?We met friends on the weekend and a friend of mine was looking to buy a new school bag for her daughter. Being curious I asked why?\nAnd she said: thoda sa fatt gaya hai\nSo I asked: but did she ask for a new bag?\nShe said: no, she hasn't asked\nSo I asked: then why do you want to buy\nShe said: because fata hua bag thode leke jayegi. Which made all of us sitting there think. Why do we buy things for our kids? Because they need them or because we need them because of our social conditioning. \n\nMy daughter also has a thousand things. And as parents, we want the best for our children. \n\nBut before shopping for anything we can try and take a step back to think: why are we buying this? Because our child needs it? Or because we want this for our child?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CqpsUQ7Il0T/",
    "Question: Why do we buy things for our kids?\nAnswer: We recently started watching Malgudi Days as a family after dinner. There were 2 reasons I chose Malgudi days was\n- first because it is about children\n- second because it is slow\n\nIt has its cons as my daughter asked: why are there no girls in it which I hadn’t noticed.\n\nBut apart from it, it’s fantastic. Unlike today’s fast-paced serials which go from one cut to another, this that, have a great script, a fantastic ending, and all hooks in place so that our eyes are always on the screen. Full attention. Malgudi days is slow. Just like life. More calming. It is a serial you can watch and go to sleep rather than your brain getting excited at the end of the day. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqu2tNJNseE/",
    "Question: Malgudi Days\nAnswer: Parent Teacher Meetings\n\nWe went for our bi-annual parent-teacher meeting yesterday. And took out 5 min to sit to think what questions did I have for the teacher.\n\nThe question that came to my head was: is there anything that you have observed that my child likes doing?\n\nThis is a question that I feel I have also missed asking in the past. And a lot of us do. We don't miss asking about how they are doing in their studies because we want our children to do well. We don't miss asking if there is any problem that we should be aware of because we are concerned about our child.\n\nWhat we often miss asking the teacher is: is there anything that you have observed that my child likes doing? When we asked this in our PTM today, the teacher replied dancing. And she shared how our daughter was originally not in the annual dance performance but came and asked to be included. This is something we didn't know. Our daughter is in a phase where she loves to dance.\n\nTry asking this in your PTM. And if your parent-teacher meeting has already happened, this is a question you can still pose to the teacher and see what comes out.\n\nWhat are other good questions to ask in PTM?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq2k3zQIqei/",
    "Question: One question to ask during Parent Teacher Meetings\nAnswer: A 14-year-old girl whose parents fight all the time was visiting my friends. And she asked an innocent question. This girl is a relative of my friends. And once in a while, she comes over to stay. They have seen her go from being an outgoing kid to becoming a quiet girl over years of seeing her parents fight.\n\nVisiting my friends is a safe place for her. And this time when she came, she asked this question after dinner. Very tentatively she asked the couple: do you pretend to be nice to each other when I am around or do you guys really never fight? Seeing her parents fight has left an impression on her mind about what marriage looks like. In her mind marriage looks like a lot of fighting. \n\nIn marriage in front of the social circle, we pretend and once no one is there we fight.\n\nBut the child is there. The child is looking. And the child carries away an impression that can easily last a lifetime. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq5KZWnoB8t/",
    "Question: Seeing parents fight all the time\nAnswer: A parent asked in messages. I hit my child, what do I do? Her 4 year old daughter was watching TV. And she refused to shut it and started screaming. This mom was also frustrated and she hit her. The child started crying and the child said: I hate you.\n\nSo the mom was worried: I hit my child, what do I do now? Well. If something like this happens to me here’s what I would tell myself. Being with a child and dealing with their tantrums can be hard. So don’t be too hard on yourself. \n\nAnd I would go to my child and hug her. And say I am sorry I hit you. I got angry. I will try not to get angry. And I love you. And I will always love you.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq7vJ3sIFdv/",
    "Question: I hit my child. What to do?\nAnswer: Parenting across cultures is different. \n\nI saw this in the sports day at school, there was a race where a child had to take a ball and do frog jumps with it till the end of line. And there were 8 kids in a line. 7 were from India and 1 kid was Japanese. And as the race started the only kid doing it properly with the right form was the Japanese kids. The Indian kids were hopping a little, bending a little but making faster progress towards the end line. \n\nNow all of them go to the same school. So this difference of following the process properly seemed and sounded like Japanese. \n\nSo after the race I went to the Japanese parents, shared my observation and said this was very good to see. And you know what they said to me? \n\nThey said: we also used to think so when we were in Japan. That following process, doing things step by step is great. But after staying in India we are no longer sure. \n\nAnd I thought wow. I thought their culture was great while all the while they are thinking the Indian kids are great may be because they ended up being faster. When we parent we automatically pass on our culture to our kids. And a lot of times we can think about that may be other cultures are better, but it is possible they are also thinking of the same thing. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CrA4QKdIQdG/",
    "Question: Parenting in different cultures\nAnswer: What is the one thing someone can do to become a better parent? I am not a Montessori-trained teacher. I am not a Waldorf educator. I am not a certified therapist. I have not done any degree for educating the child or the parent.\n\nI am only someone who has been curious about why people are the way they are. And it seems like it starts with childhood. The environment creates the child and parents create the environment. All my insights come from observation or research. \n\nAnd if you have time you can do a thousand things to become a better parent. You can read books, and do courses but if you don’t have the time, then the simplest thing you can do is to take a little step back from your child’s life. \n\nSpend more time with them but observe rather than interfere. \nIf we can observe our child without interfering, only do that, both our lives and the child’s life can change. \n\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrInbEMoipt/",
    "Question: One thing you can do to become a better parent\nAnswer: One of the parents wrote to me. My elder child has started hitting the younger child. I have tried scolding him and punishing him but he has not stopped. What should I do? This situation is both funny and sad. \n\nBecause the problem here is not the older child hitting the younger child. But the problem is why is he hitting? He’s not a mad kid so why will he hit his younger brother? When a younger child comes, naturally parents’ attention moves to the new child. This can cause anxiety and a lack of connection with the older child. His brain starts to think of the younger child as a competitor. And hitting starts. \n\nIn this case, spending 1 on 1 time with the older child is key to making him feel secure. \n\nSo the answer lies not in scolding him or punishing him but in giving him more love. The older child is the one who actually needs more love from the parent\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrKvFSyo17-/",
    "Question: My child hits his sibling\nAnswer: The truth is we don’t know our real children. \n\nThis hit me in a discussion happening between parents of older children. 17-18 years old. And they had opposing stories to tell. On one side was a parent who had believed in discipline. The child had listened to him, followed rules for the longest time but last month and at the age of 17 had rebelled. He wasn’t listening any more. And the father didn’t know what to do.\n\nOn the other side was a parent who just because his child was an introvert had thought his child was too soft. But when a family emergency arose, the teenage child took control of the situation, handled it so well his father was surprised. As they were telling these I thought that our impression of our children comes from what we think of them or sometimes what we want them to be. \n\nBut the real child can only emerge in an atmosphere which is free of judgement and expectations. And if our house does not have that atmosphere the real child will likely emerge only when they hit late teens or when they leave the house.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrNTjDWorom/",
    "Question: Is this my child?\nAnswer: Moments with kids are fickle. Kids were playing and the water sprinklers in the garden came on. And the kids just started to have fun in them. Running around, letting a few drops fall on them. And the mothers said: arey don’t go like this change your clothes. kapre kharaab ho jayenge, bimmar ho jaoge. And took them to change clothes.\n\nAnd the moment passed. \n\nThis happens with adults also. Friends sitting at a place chatting, mahaul bana hua hai. Then some interruption, some change and it is all gone. The moment is lost. Moments with children whether they are about play or about concentrating on something. are even more fickle. \n\nInterruption by parents is a big reason why a child cannot focus on his own sense of agency.\n\nAnd every day I ask myself more and more, how can I let my child be? How can we do 1% parenting, leaving 99% of the time free for our kids?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrSewJBMoXc/",
    "Question: Arey Bimaar ho jaoge\nAnswer: A mother wrote to ask\nI saw that my 7-year-old daughter and her 10-year-old cousin were playing with each other. And touching each other near their private parts and giggling. I am worried, what should I do? I don’t want to scare her. First of all kudos to the mother, that she did not jump and say ‘what are you doing, stop this nonsense’ Because the only thing it would have brought is some sense of shame and this behavior would then be repeated in the close room when mom isn’t watching.\n\nThe idea is to realize that for kids at that age, this is just fun. Some of that is picked from school and some from movies where the hero and heroine are teasing each other in dances. So the kids are just being curious. And there is an easy way to solve this.\n\nWhat we can say to the kid is \"We don’t touch someone else's genital area. It is a sensitive area. It’s okay to be curious, but we want to be safe with each other.”\n\nAnd if anyone touches you, you can tell me. \nAnd say all of this with utmost love and care.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CraLUE1oWXF/",
    "Question: Cousins touching each other\nAnswer: We don’t want to go. We want to play.\n\nGetting kids to stop playing and go home can be hard. But there is a simple way. Let’s say kids are playing at your friends house and it is time to go home, time for dinner. But the kids want to play more. \n\nyou are tired from the whole day and the only thing you want is that somehow the kid is asleep. So you say, let’s go home. They say no. You say it is time we have to go. And they say no. This is a good recipe for a shouting match or power struggle. \n\nSo what can we do? What I do is start by sitting with them at their level so that there is a sense of connection. Then I ask them: do you want to play more? The obvious answer is yes. Further connection. Then I say but you know it is school tomorrow and we have to eat dinner and go to sleep. To which there is another yes. Further connection. But you want to play more right? How many min? By now they are listening. And generally, the answer is 5 or 10 min. So we see the clock together and we are done. After 5 min they are happy to go home. \nThis is actually easy to do once you realize that the only thing child is looking for to say yes is a bit of connection with the parent. To feel included. To feel they are one with you.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Crcw_MkPno6/",
    "Question: Time to go home\nAnswer: My child is crying before going to school. Is there something wrong with the school? My friend had been complaining about her kid crying while going to school. The child is 3 years old. And she was worried if the school was ok.\n\nThen one day as my wife and I were going to drop our daughter, I saw her in the lift with her son. Her son was saying, I don’t want to go mumma. And she was saying: arey don’t worry, we are not going to school beta. And he became quiet. \n\nSo during the day, I called my friend and I said to her: can you stop lying to your kid. Just because you don’t want him to cry in the lift. This is not worth your trust with the child.\n\nTo her credit, she stopped lying about going to school. But what surprised me was when she told me this: that her kid has stopped crying altogether before going to school. I was surprised that this was so simple and easy. \n\nThat there was nothing wrong with the school and the child crying only because of the anxiety caused by not being able to trust the person he loves the most.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrfWmoErkvE/",
    "Question: Mother lying. Child crying. \nAnswer: My friend pinged me to say that his daughter is in 9th class but doesn’t know what to pursue. Also she has not picked any hobby like reading , playing etc so she is getting bored often. \n\nWhat should he do? I had only one question to ask him: does your daughter spend a lot of time on mobile. The answer was a big yes. \n\nShe was using it more than she should and the constant dopamine hit that one gets from mobile prevented the child from thinking long-term, prevented the child from developing a hobby that they enjoy. Prevented them from doing hard work. \n\nWhen both parents are working or when we have a single child in the house, it is so easy to let the mobile take over. Hence early intervention is necessary otherwise you will be left with a child who has no hobbies, or interests and does not know how to concentrate on a task. \n\nMy friends daughter is 15 and I think even if my friend starts paying attention now he has a long way ahead of him to restore concentration because the main years of development of the brain are gone and now the mind is concrete. But if he does not start now, this could get much worse. \n\nIn this age of screens, ensuring that screen time is limited is probably the number one thing for a parent to be careful of. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrnVZCvo2Fg/",
    "Question: My child is on mobile all the time\nAnswer: I had gone for a run when I saw a mother and her 6 year old walking. She was holding her child’s hand. But then suddenly the child left her hand and started running in the grass. And the mom started shouting ‘Bhago mat, gir jaoge’, Bhago mat, gir jaoge. And ran after her.\n\nAnd I was wondering that the mother would have genuinely felt fear that her daughter will fall and hurt herself. The daughter was not afraid but she stopped. Kids at this age have a need to run. For their muscles to grow, for their brains to develop, to become strong there is an innate desire to run.\n\nAnd as I was running I was left wondering how many times do we stop our kids from being strong and independent just because of our own fears as adults.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrsoZk3IxtN/",
    "Question: Bhago mat, gir jaoge\nAnswer: If you are at a stage of life where you feel you haven’t been a good parent, what can you do? Firstly let’s look at what we generally do. We either internalize or externalize the situation. Externalize means we either say that we are not at fault. Meri koi galti nahin. Bacha hi aisa hai.\n\nOr we internalize the situation. We can go in depression by thinking that we have fucked it up. \n\nBoth these things don’t help the current situation. \n\nSo what can one do? The only solution is to start now. Be the parent that you wanted to be. Now. It is never too late for anything. It can be difficult but it is still possible. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrvNrUtN9y7/",
    "Question: I am a bad parent\nAnswer: One thing that science has proved is that our child’s brain is always busy wiring for adulthood. We had gone to Sukhna lake in Chandigarh with our big family. The lake was busy - from ice cream to popcorn, to juices to bumper cars there was everything. Also on the lake were some people sitting and making portraits. The kids were fascinated by it. They stood and observed. Then they approached the adults and said: we want to get our portrait made. This is a case where the child wanted to concentrate but the adults stopped it. Just because we thought short-term about saving 15 min. \n\nAnd we forgot that in the long term for the child to accomplish anything hard in life, it will take effort and concentration and that won’t come from doing more and more things.\n\nWhen the adults asked the portrait guy he said making it will take 20 min. The kids were ok. They were willing to sit at a place and get it done. But the adult thinking said: arey then how will we see the lake and all the other things so someone said: this will take too long and why don’t you do bumper cars. \n\nThe attention of kids was broken and they went to eat ice cream and play bumper cars.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrxzhCiIz9x/",
    "Question: Raising kids in distracted world\nAnswer: What is a big difference between Montessori and normal schooling?\n\nOne big difference is that kids of different age study together. So in Montessori a class is not like all kids of age 4 are in say LKG . Or kids of age 5 in UKG.\n\nBut there is like a batch of kids of different ages say between 4 years to 6 years of age who study together. Who are all learning from each other. A 6 year old could help a 4 year old learn a concept that she knows. So the 6 year old learns in some ways to teach and it helps a 4 year old learn faster.\n\nThis is also more similar to how real life works. When we work on a project in our company, we are all of different ages, all of us have different strengths. We all learn from each other. Because if you see a 4 year old has little to learn from another 4 year old but a lot to learn from a 6 year old.  \n\nSo this multi age group in Montessori is something that helps children truly learn subjects and from each other. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr28zL2oXCi/",
    "Question: Difference between Montessori and normal schooling\nAnswer: A mother wrote and said: I got separated from my husband when I was expecting my child. I have a fear of what if she will ask one day about her father. And can I do this alone.\nAnd she said can you tell me how to deal with this, how can I help myself first to build confidence in her that it's ok to have a single parent and it's normal. When I read this I felt single parenting can be hard. It can be lonely. And it can feel difficult. \n\nBut I wanted to tell every single parent out there something: that all and I mean ALL research points towards the same thing:  that a child needs the company of only 1 loving adult to do well in life. So don't worry, what has happened has happened. Single parenting can be more work but if you are loving then for the child it makes no difference.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-q6ZWoDjd/",
    "Question: Are you a single parent?\nAnswer: My kid keeps calling me all the time. He always wants my attention. Mumma dekha, dadda suno. Many of us feel this way. Let's say our child is playing with a toy or you have taken your kid to a hobby class. You are thinking I have done my job: now I will make a phone call, walk a little, read a book, just have some peace time. But your kid keeps asking you to keep looking. Mumma dekho mein kya kar rahi hoon. Dadda see. It can be frustrating. It seems like the child wants your attention all the time. \n\nBut the truth is kids don't care about attention. Kids want to feel loved. When that love goes missing, when there are not enough hugs happening, when there are not enough smiles happening, not enough cuddling happening, that is when they are clutching on straws and asking for attention. If you want to stop this behavior, give your kids more hugs, cuddle them more. \n\nThe pro tip is - Give them one right before you have to start doing something. Remember, no kid wants attention. Kids want love.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsBPvuioI7w/",
    "Question: My child keeps calling me all the time. What do I do?\nAnswer: Why did you do susu on the floor? Why did you hit the girl? These are some why questions that we ask young kids. \nWe ask these questions because a lot of times we are frustrated. Sometimes even expecting answers from our young child. \n\nThe truth is the child can't answer. \n\nBecause the child does not know. Introducing thinking and reflection is a valuable skill but for a young child say <5 years old who lives in the moment, whose prefrontal cortex isn't developed, these question can only bring shame because they really don't know. \nWhat we can do to show them what the child should do instead. We can say to the susu child: help me clean the floor. If you are feeling like susu, call mumma. \n\nOr we can say to the child who is hitting: no using hands and feet. \n\nThis is how they can learn what is the right thing to do next time. \n\nNot by our asking -  ‘Why’ did you do this!\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsD0zh5IRaw/",
    "Question: Why did you do this?\nAnswer: 40-50% of first pregnancies fail. Everyone should know this.\n\nWhen we were trying to have kids, after our first pregnancy failed. We went to the doctor, all sad and he said: don't worry 40-50% of times, first pregnancy fails.\nAnd we were like, who is supposed to tell us. \n\nNobody talks about it. We had never heard of it from friends, family that after a certain age having a child can be so hard. \n\nWhile the best solution is to have kids early enough this does not mean that you should have a child when you are not mentally ready. \nBut the reason I think everyone should know that pregnancy is hard is so that person can change their diet, can stay fitter, can preserve your eggs, do 50 other things to ensure that when you want to have kids, you can have them. This statistic was given to me by our gynaecologist. \n\nOnline research shows that \nthe failure rate in chemical pregnancies (first 5 weeks) is 8-33%\nfailure rate in clinical pregnancies (after 5 weeks) is 25%\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsQsITko9A9/",
    "Question: 40-50% of first pregnancies fail. \nAnswer: My child does not listen to me. A lot of parents feel that. Here is an easy way to change it. \n\nLet children bear the consequences of their decisions and they will learn. \n\nSay if you are going out to a place where their will be lot of walking, where you know your child will be more comfortable in shoes, but the child wants to wear sandals. You can remind once, but let her wear. If you really want, just carry shoes along. And once the child realizes that it is difficult with sandals, they will ask for shoes. \n\nGive it to them without saying ‘I told you’ \nThen without having had to force your point of view, your child has learnt. \n\nTo learn from their experience is an invaluable lesson for anyone. And they have also learnt that it is good to listen to my parents sometime :-) \nThey will learn themselves and they will also learn that sometimes listening to parents helps. \n ----\n\nMost decisions that we try tomakee for our kids are trivial. Most things if we let the child do won’t really impact life in the long run. So let us let children take those decisions. Let them learn both that they \n- can make mistakes and correct them \n- can trust their parents. <heart>\n\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsTSw-1oucR/",
    "Question: My child does not listen to me. What to do?\nAnswer: Let's say you have gone to someone's house and we sit down and we are chatting. \nThey are saying all the right things but you can sense that you are unwelcome. There is something which tells you they are busy and may be you should go. You are being told to stay but you know what they really mean is go. \n\nOur body, our mind can sense. \nSimilarly a child can sense what is expected of him rather than being told what to do. So say if the child is say walking on a wall and you say don't fall, be careful - while the child is hearing 'don't fall', the subconscious brain can sense what is expected of him by the person he loves and depends on 'is to fall'. And falls. So we go rush to him and tell him, see I told you. \n\nBut the truth is we not only told him, there is a high chance we caused it in the first place.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsV2R9fMWkH/",
    "Question: Expecting our child to fail\nAnswer: I remember the moment when I felt saddest with my daughter. \nShe was 5 years old. And we had gone to my mother in law’s house in Bombay. Behind their house is a hill. And I wanted to take my daughter to climb that. I have been mountaineering for 12 years and I enjoy being in nature. And it was evening so we started walking towards the hill but when she went there, she refused to climb up. She said: I don't want to climb. I want to go home. I cajoled, I tried. But she was firm. That was the moment I felt the saddest, that the one thing I had thought I will truly enjoy doing with my daughter. It was not happening. \nBut thankfully I listened to her and we went back home. I say thankfully because later that day I realised that there was no problem with her, but with my already built expectation from the child. That she will enjoy climbing hills and I will climb with her. \n\nWhen that illusion was shattered I felt bad. \n\nEven though it was hard what I learnt that day was something far more valuable: I learnt to let go of defining how I wanted my child to be.\n\nHere’s a poem that has been a guide to so many parents.\n\nYour children are not your children.\n     They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.\n     They come through you but not from you,\n     And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\n\n     You may give them your love but not your thoughts,\n     For they have their own thoughts.\n     You may house their bodies but not their souls,\n     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.\n     You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.\n     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.\n     You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.\n     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.\n     Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;\n     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsbAA9PsCm3/",
    "Question: What do you want your child to be?\nAnswer: I have a question. As an adult do you lack time to follow your interests or do you lack knowledge?\nI will share why I am asking this. \n\nI had done a post on a teenage girl preparing for a debate in school on a topic she has no interest in. Lots of parents responded by saying that giving topics like this is ok because how will she know about things that she does not know about.\nBut all of us have a lot of knowledge on various subjects but what do we do with it? Nothing. What most of us really want is time to pursue our interests. \n\nHence the imp thing is to find ways to allow a child to pursue their interest and not give random topics in which the child has no interest. \nIf you really think knowledge does not lead to self-confidence. Self-confidence comes from understanding. That understanding can only happen with interest. Not without that. So it is important our children spend time on things that they have interest in. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Csdkf8oIAkY/",
    "Question: Filling kids with knowledge\nAnswer: How can I develop my child’s brain? A lot of parents think about using learning toys. Because scientists have always been studying this. So let me share an experiment they did.\nThey took mice and put them in two different cages. \nOne cage was the cage which was empty had nothing to do. And the other was a cage which had a wheel for mice to go around in (like a learning toy)\n\nIn which mice do you think brain development happened the most? Take a guess.\n\nIt was in the mice who was free. In his natural environment. And not in a cage.\nThis is relevant because for millions of years we have lived in nature. For the last few decades we have started raising our children in apartments. \n\nBut if we really want brain development for our child, stop buying learning toys. Take him outdoors.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsitDOGLWCb/",
    "Question: Stop buying learning toys\nAnswer: If your child reverses letters and you go online there is a lot of advice. \nThat to correct reversing of letters you see advice like \n• You can make a page with b and d both written on it many times. And ask child to circle b’s\n• Or you can take two real buckets, label one b and one d and you can make paper balls on which b or d is written and ask child to throw in the right paper basket\n\nAll of this leads us to think that there is something wrong with our child. And that as a parent I need to do something otherwise my child will keep reversing letters all their life. \nBut the truth is we don’t need to do anything. Children reverse letters coz their brains don’t have a place for reading and writing. This is formed fully only by age 8. Why this is the case you can see in description. \n\nSo in 99.99% cases you don’t need to do anything. So we can take a chill pill and let children be! Human brain has been evolving for 2 million years. So our brain has a place for object identification which means that a cup should remain a cup no matter if it is ulta phulta. A scissor should be a scissor no matter how it is kept.\nBut alphabets don’t behave that way. b ko ulta karo do d ban jaata hai. And because reading and writing are only 5000 years old so our brain hasn’t adapted to accommodate this. This is the reason children reverse letters.\n\nBy the age of 8 an area called VWFA Visual Word Form Area is automatically created as the child is exposed to reading and writing.\nIn 99% cases you don’t need to worry if your child reverses letters. There is no need to correct. It will self correct. As is actually the case with most things that our children do :-)\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CslS69FIKiR/",
    "Question: My child with reverses letters. How do I help?\nAnswer: How would you feel if no one in the world understood you? Ask yourself this. If it feels like no one in the world understands you. How will you feel? You will feel like crying right? \nThat is how the child feels. That is why the child cries. That the child feels no one is able to understand what I want. What my need is?\nWhat do I do to make my parents understand? \nLet me cry. \n\nBecause as parents we have missed the small initial signals that the child gave - whether they were of rubbing his eyes, or a yawn, or licking their lips. \nAnd what we can do is rather than worrying about our child, we can start observing him so that we don’t miss the small signs that he is giving us. And our little child can feel understood.\n\nSometimes when we say: I can't understand what my child is crying, we as parents are right. Because we have missed the small signs because they are easy to miss if you are not looking for them. But once we start observing our children, we can easily understand what is happening and also make them feel understood <heart>\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Csn3pi6rb6K/",
    "Question: What is no one in the world understood you?\nAnswer: What is the worst gift you can give to a child?\nA friend called me to ask that yaar meri niece birthday pe phone maang rahi hai. Woh bol rahi hai, mama koi nahin leke de raha, aap mujhe pata hai leke doge. \n\nMein zyada mil nahin paata hoon, de doon? \n\nAs many of us get more money than we need, as grandparents and relatives meet children less and want to be liked and loved by them. It is happening that on birthday the child is asking for a phone or an iPad or a playstation and the parent or grandparent or a relative are gifting it. \nThis is the worst gift we can give to a child. \n\nTo take him away from the real world and get him lost in a screen. A child's brain has to develop and it can only develop through real life experiences. It stops developing if the child gets lost in a screen and once the age of developing is past, we can't undo it. \n\nSo while we love our kids, grandkids, nephew, nieces, we don't need to buy love by gifting screen. It could be the worst thing we can do for them.\n\nWe do not need to get our child’s love using gifts or candies. We can do so by being more playful with them and meeting more often. At the end of the day those are the memories that we and our children will remember. And they are better memories than of children hunched up on screen.\n\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CstBLQQIdnT/",
    "Question: What is the worst gift you can give to a child?What is the worst gift you can give to a child?\nAnswer: Do you feel your child does not listen? Let me tell you a story.\nSchool had organized a trip to the beach. The idea was to see different kinds of animal life as the tide goes out. \n\nIt was a wonderful session. Just that I thought my daughter wasn’t listening. She was busy doing something in the sand with her fingers or talking to a friend while the person was talking or showing a crab that we just saw. In my head she wasn’t paying attention. While I was listening with full attention.\n\nAnd 2 weeks later we ended up going to stay at a beach resort. There on the beach we found the shell of a crab. I remembered we had seen it on the school beach walk. But I was struggling to remember its name. I can’t even remember it now. But Diya was playing on the beach, she  said: dadda this crab is called so and so and went back to playing\nAs adults we expect kids to sit still and listen to what is being said. That is an adult way of learning. \n\nKids are much more aware. Much more alert. They can be moving around and still absorb all the learning. While adults like me can concentrate and still forget.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Csvlg4btejV/",
    "Question: Are you listening?\nAnswer: A mother wrote to me and said: \nMy son is 7 years old and he goes down in society garden to play. And he has friends. But I have seen that some kids target him unnecessarily and without reason, get into fight, chasing, pushing etc. I have told these kids sternly that this is wrong, don't do that.\n\nis that ok? This is what the mother asked. \nNow let's see what has happened\n1. first of all we think that children are doing something without reason, which is never true. We might be unable to see or understand the reason but there is always a reason.\n\n2. Secondly when we are stern with our kids friends then what will they do - they will either target him more in your absence or they will stop playing with him thinking why take panga, his mother will come and shout.\n\n\nEither ways it is a loss for our child and while we wanted to rectify the situation, what we have done is made it worse. \n\nIf there is no chance of big physical harm, it might be best for parents to just observe and not interfere.\n\nA lot of times children can resolve things themselves. Our children are more resilient than we give them credit for. Also a lot of times the story is more deeper than it seems to a parent. Children have their own world and rules.\n\nHave you ever felt like intervening? What did you do?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cs0wDeQo2Xu/",
    "Question: Unnecessary target or bully\nAnswer: The child falls down and starts crying. And grandparent starts hitting the floor. Floor ganda hai. Floor ganda hai. Maara isne mere bete ko.\n\nA lot of people do this. And it does seem to work. But is it harmless?\nWhat the grandparent is actually doing is distracting the child. And this distraction stops the child from crying. Because their mind is now distracted from the fall. This may seem like a good thing but it’s not.\n\nFirstly because the child did not need this attention at all. If you have seen a child fall, then after they have fallen, they will look around to see if anyone is looking at them and if the parent is looking, they will start crying. So the first step we can do is not react at all.\n\nAnd secondly, what we are saying is a lie. And teaching the child that it is ok to blame others. That if you are getting hurt, the fault does not lie with you, but with someone else. Today a child is learning to blame the floor, tomorrow they will blame someone else for their problems in life.\n\n\nSo what should an adult do: well if the child looks at you you can smile a bit and you can continue doing whatever you were busy with giving it no special importance. Rather than blaming the floor.\n\nURL: ",

    "Question: Floor ganda hai (hin)\nAnswer: 12 year old girl sad that her periods haven't come\n\nA friends daughter who is 12 year old is sad that her periods haven’t come.\n\nAll her friends in school have had periods and she is the only one remaining. \n\nAs I heard her, I felt how sad is this, that a 12 year old feels left out because her periods haven’t come. \n\nPeriods used to come at 14-15 years of age and now I know of two 7 year old’s who have gotten periods and are on hormonal therapy. \n\nWe can blame may be oxytocin in milk for this, we can blame processed junk food or we can blame lack of outdoors. \n\nOr may be we can just blames ourselves, that we have let this happen. Because the child did not know.  \n\nSo if you are a parent of a young girl, the best thing you can do for her is to not give adulterated milk, not have junk food and ensure she gets to exercise and play a lot. May be she will feel left out in her class, but sometimes that can be good news. \n---------------\nDescription\n\nPeriods for girls are coming earlier and are more painful. This is reality. While I want to spend more time researching what parents can do is STOP junk food (almost any packaged food which has a number of ingredients like INS etc), milk, use of cosmetics, perfumes and increase outdoor exercise. And if you want to have milk find a source where cows have not been given any growth hormones. We don’t need milk. Is milk bad? I don’t know yet. But milk with growth hormones is not good for both us and our children.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cs55bLGg020/",
    "Question: My periods haven’t come\nAnswer: A school called all parents and did this exercise. They asked the parents to choose 6 values that they would like to inculcate in your child. \nSo the parents had to form groups and shared with each other what values they had picked. My friend was there. And in the group that she was in, she was shocked to find that a set of parents had picked manipulation as a value to teach their child. She couldn’t think of why would a parent do that.\nEach one of us has our own story. And on the basis of that, we want different things for our children. Will I pick manipulative for my child? I wouldn’t but I don’t know what the situation of the other parent was. What her background was?\n\nBut nevertheless, this is a good exercise to do with your husband, wife, or partner.

    "Question: What values do you want in your child\nAnswer: Jab ho sakta hai, tab tumhein karna nahin hai. Jab karna chahoge, tab hoga nahin.\nA lot of couples are busy. They are busy with their careers, multiple other things and they want to live life. And this is absolutely ok, there is no problem as long as you don’t want to have kids. \n\nBecause what is also reality is that overall 20% couples are unable to have children. And this percentage rises to a lot more if the couple is >30 years of age. \nSo if you want to have kids, then it is best to take a step back, stop being busy and understands what is the right age to have kids, do all the things one should do to increase chances of ensuring kids can happen when you want them. So that it is not a hard journey for you later in life.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtBntVZoGQs/",
    "Question: Too busy to have kids?\nAnswer: If you are putting your child in a Montessori school. there is an important thing to remember. \n\nBecause one way in which Montessori is different from other schooling is that all the students in a class don't learn the same thing or move at the same pace. What does this mean? \nIn a normal school all 4 year old’s in say LKG are supposed to know the same things. All 5 year old’s are supposed to know the same thing. \n\nBut in Montessori 4 to 6 year old’s study together. And a key idea is to follow the child so if a child has interest in mathematics then they can actually spend all their time on maths. So what happens is that a 4 year old might know more maths than a 6 year old of another school but might know less English as compared to a 4 year old in another school. \nSo it is imp to keep your child in Montessori till at least age 6 because in between if you shift schools and put them in a class where everyone is supposed to know the same thing, it could be a bit difficult.\n\nSo before you put your child in Montessori, understand the philosophy a little bit more so that you have the courage to follow the philosophy and your child for a few years.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtGxJfYuo8R/",
    "Question: Montessori - one thing to know while taking admission \nAnswer: A baby's cry is as serious as it sounds'. This is said by Jean Leidloff who spent years with tribes in Amazon forest and observing children. She shares that for millions of years, a child who was born was always in body to body touch with his mother. Almost all the time. Morning to evening, day to night. If the mother was going to get water, she took the child, if the mother made food, she kept the child on her lap. And this is what evolution has taught a new born child to expect.\n\nBut in today's modern world a child is wrapped in clothes and kept in a cradle. This child is unable to feel the full touch of the mother. In between the mother feeds the baby and keeps him aside. When she is keeping the child back even though she feels for a moment she shouldn't do it, she should keep the baby with her she goes ahead because everyone has told her, if she does not want to spoil the child, she must keep him in the cradle. So she does it.\n\nAnd when the mother puts the child back for the child the mother as well be in mars, not one feet away. Because one feet is too much. \n\nFor millions of years the touch and heartbeat of her mother has been the need of the new born baby. So this baby's crying is as serious as it sounds. It is the sound of unfulfilled love. And Jean says this unfulfilled love is the cause of most problems we see later. \n\nSo this cry of the baby needs to be answered by the touch of skin and love of the parent.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtJV82YI63x/",
    "Question: A baby's cry is serious\nAnswer: Arey 10th kar lo life set hai\n12th kar lo life set hai\nCollege kar lo life set hai\nJob kar lo life set\nArey shaadi kar lo life set hai\nArey bachey kar lo. Pehle ek do saal mushkil hota hai phir life set hai. \nAacha aacha, arey ek aur bacha kar lo, dono saath mein khelenge phir life set hai\nAacha nahin khel rahe, lad rahe hai. Kuch nahin hota bade ho jayenge phir dekhna life set hai\nDekhiye mummy daddy aisa lagg raha hai hum jabse paida hue hai  life set hi chal rahi hai!\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtL7L0uoa1T/",
    "Question: Life set hai\nAnswer: So how do young kids really learn? \n\nSomeone shared that they were travelling by train and a chai waala passed by saying chai chai chai chai. And after some time their 21 month old daughter also started saying chai chai chai chai. \nAs a concept this is called observational learning. \n\nThis is how kids learn. Not because the chai waala said to her: you repeat after me chai chai. It just happened. \nThis is how children are. Not small and dumb who need to be taught. But like a sponge absorbing anything, learning all the time.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtREghhoJTQ/",
    "Question: How children learn?\nAnswer: This is a house, not a hotel. \n\nThis is what the mother told the boy.\nThe boy who was telling me this story is 18 year old now. This happened when he was 10 years old. He sat down for dinner, his mother had cooked food. And he didn’t like what was there and he said I don’t want to eat this, make something else for me. And the mother said: This is a house, not a hotel. If you can eat what is made, it is ok, otherwise you can sleep hungry. \n\nHe did not eat. He went to bed hungry that day. He woke up went to school hungry. His mother did not ask him to eat or make something else. \n\nThe 18-year-old told him he was thankful to his mother for saying this because he now eats what he gets. He understands how big a deal it is to just have food on the table rather than being fussy about what you want to eat.\nThe point is that as parents a lot of times we bend over backwards to satisfy our children. And we mistake this for love. This is not love. This is spoiling.\n\nOur role as a parent is not to spoil our child. Our role is to raise an independent and confident adult who understands himself, his parents, and his place in the world. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtTqCgfIHVp/",
    "Question: This is a house, not a hotel. \nAnswer: When we want to teach our children something - we tell them what we want to teach and then we ask them - do you follow. Have you understood?\nThe child will say yes or no. And the parent generally will explain it again - look I am saying that you have to take care of this or do that. \nBut actually what the parent should be doing is asking the child: can you tell me what you understood? \nBecause that is what we are looking for: whether my child got what I was saying which will not happen by repeating but by helping the child absorb and share back\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtYy0etP7o7/",
    "Question: have you understood?\nAnswer: Some parents worry a lot about what we say to our children. We want to measure each word, say the right things. But here is what I think: what you say matters less. How you say it matters more? \nIf you have an old friend, who gives you gaali, or when he meets you says hello to you with gaali, it doesn't matter to you, because the tone of his voice is warm and full of love. \n\nThe same thing works with kids: we can say the nicest things to them but if we say them rudely, that's what they will take away. And we can say the wrong words but if the child knows it comes from a place of love, they will get it. \nBecause what matters less are the words and what matters more is the feeling we convey to the child.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtbbWbXvkJi/",
    "Question: Words matter less, feelings matter more\nAnswer: Here is a beautiful example of how a parent helped their child overcome fear. \nThe family had gone to stay in a hotel. And in the hotel room were prints of black and white pictures. Somehow the daughter got scared because she had never seen black and white pictures and refused to sleep in the room.\n\nSo you know what the parent did? The parent calmed her down, and then took a picture of her own daughter on the phone, showed it to her. Then asked her to press the button which changed it to black and white. \n\nHe did this simple thing to make his daughter overcome her fear. Another parent might have said: arey why are you scared, kaise ho tum, you are now old enough, how can you be scared. \nBut this parent understood that a child’s fear is real. And took such a simple approach to solve it. \n\nThis is possible is each and every situation. Every parent can look at a situation curiously and find a solution to overcome their child’s fear.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctd8soaoZYE/",
    "Question: Overcoming our child’s fear\nAnswer: Children have a unique way of looking at things.\nOne of my friends has identical twins. And we were meeting them and adults were trying to figure out who is who. Which child is which one. And we were unable to do that. \n\nAnd my daughter then said: i know. And she said: this one is this, and that one name is this. And she was right so we asked her: how did you know? And she said: they carry different colour water bottles. \nAnd we were all laughing about it. As adults our minds are quiet shut and linear. A child’s mind is very flexible and will come up with unique solutions if we let them. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtlqzsXo0jI/",
    "Question: Unique way of looking at things\nAnswer: Here is something a parent can do to make their life simple. \n\nThe idea is to: ‘Give our child a clear answer’ \nIf your child has asked you: when can I get a phone of my own: tell them when you are 18 years old. \n\nDon’t say - we will see. \nDon’t say - jab aap bade ho jaoge. \nDon’t say - mumma ko nahin pata, dadda se poocho. \n\nIf you don’t know then say, I haven’t thought about it. Mein soch ke bataoongi aapko.\nGiving our child a clear answer is one of the easiest things we can do to make our and our child’s life simple.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctq0kjeIKSf/",
    "Question: Simple thing to make a parents life simple\nAnswer: Ek bada reason bachpan imp hota hai kyon bachey chote hote sponge ke tarah hote hai. \nJo bhi unke aas pass ho raha hota hai woh absorb kar lete hai. Sab kuch - pyaar hai to pyaar, ladai hai to ladai. \n\nTo unko kuch bhi seekhnae mein mehnat nahin lagti. Automatic ho jaata hai. \n\nAur woh same cheez thoda bade hoke sikhane mein, batane mein jaan nikal jaati hai. \nIsliye bachey ki zindagi ke pehle 6 saal mein humnein theek cheezein sikha di, kar di to baaki ki zindagi bahut aasaan ho sakti hai. Isliye bachpan imp hota hai!\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CttZPcvx8C5/",
    "Question: Bachpan ki importance\nAnswer: A friends daughter was refusing to wear her shoes because they were muddy. And there was an ongoing power struggle: she said to the parent you wash them for me. And the parent was saying: no you please wash yourself. So she said: But I don’t know how to wash. So the parent said: what do you mean, this is so simple. And this was going on\nThey are good friends so I stepped in and I said: beta, let me wash one for you. You can see how it is done, and then you can wash the second one, is that ok? She said ok. So I washed one, and then she washed the second and we went to have some chai and pakora together. \nSuch situations present themselves maybe 10 times a day. \n\nAnd if we can step back and think of them as learning opportunities rather than power struggles, if we can meet our children MID WAY our relationship with our children can completely change. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctv-mTxI794/",
    "Question: Meeting our children mid-way\nAnswer: What does a SHY child mean? \n\nWe keep calling our kids SHY. Mera bacha SHY hai, but what does it mean in research? \nOne of the very few markers of a SHY child that scientists have been able to find is that at the age of 3-6 months if a new object like a mobile or something was given to a child most children will be excited, look at it and start playing. But some children actually start getting anxious, cranky and start crying. These are very very few children who do this. \n\nWhen scientists followed these children for many years, these are the children who turned out to be SHY. This is the one scientific way to know if your child is SHY. \n\nA SHY child is one who wants to talk to other people but is unable to because of something going on in their brain.\nMost of our children are not SHY. They just love their parents. They love the comfort of hugging them, staying around them and as they will get more confident, they will in their own time play with other kids. \n\nSo let’s stop calling our kids SHY, because they are not.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtyioMUo4t3/",
    "Question: Is your child shy?\nAnswer: Are you parenting with love or are you parenting with concern\nKeeping healthy food for our child is love. \nBut asking our child again and again, do you want this, do you want that, are you hungry that is concern. \nWhen we parent with love, we raise a secure adult. \nWhen we parent with concern we raise a child who does not really know what he/she is feeling because most of his life has gone into ensuring his parents are ok with the choices he has made or his choices have always been made by the parent. \n\nUnderstanding this simple difference between love and concern can make a big difference in how our child turns out.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ct1HZItor5n/",
    "Question: Difference between love and concern\nAnswer: I was walking with my friend's daughter who is a 2-3 years younger than my daughter. And after 5 sec I realized I was almost pulling her. \nLike she must have felt a pull between our hands. And that is when I realized that this is maybe how we have been growing our children. \n\nThat they feel a pull to walk faster, to learn faster, to grow faster, to live through life faster. \nAnd can we let go of the pull? Can we let our children be?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ct3sUXlo2Zj/",
    "Question: Pulling our child\nAnswer: Mumma\n\n\nThe child called out to the mother. The mother was busy in work. You said: wait. The child called again. The mother said: wait. The child called again. The mother said: arey can't you wait. I will come na. The child called again. \n\nBy now the parent has lost it :-), the child is irritating.\n\nBut the thing is: the child does not know what wait means? It means 10 sec, one minute, 5 min, 10 min? The child does not know. Which is the reason he keeps calling. That is something we should understand from the child’s point of view.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ct81v41I9OM/",
    "Question: Wait! can you please wait?\nAnswer: What is the one thing parents misunderstand about screen time\nMost parents think the biggest problem with screen time is the impact of the screen on the brain of the child. Or on the eyes. That is a big impact but that is not the biggest impact,\n\nThe bigger problem with spending time on screens, on social media is that it takes time away from all the other things that the child’s brain needs to develop \nlike going outdoors, \nlearning to play with friends\ndeveloping of concentration on a task,\n\nAll of this goes missing. \nThere is a certain age at which at which different part of child’s brain develops and the child learns different skills like speaking, being with others. \n\nDon’t let that time pass on screens. \n\nWhat is harmful are not only the screens but what the child is missing because of being on screen.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ct_bfSaoi5m/",
    "Question: One thing parents misunderstand about screen time\nAnswer: ‘Arey don’t read book while eating’\n\nMy daughter has got into this habit of reading while eating. And I kept telling her - don’t read book while eating, don’t read book while eating. \nAnd then I suddenly realized for some children this is a mobile and for some children this is a book. There is no difference. The thing will keep changing.\n\nAnd what I should be talking to her about is not what not to do. But what to do. \nBecause what we are really looking for and what I really want to say is: eat with awareness\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuCASyUNvuU/",
    "Question: Don't read while eating\nAnswer: A friend of mine who is 40 years old just found out that she has a small bone in her nose which prevents her from breathing properly. \nAnd she was telling me that this is the reason now she realises that she used to breath from mouth so often coz the bone blocks air from going. This was the reason she could never enjoy running or play sports like that. And everyone around her made her feel that she was lazy or just didn’t want to put effort. But there was no way for anyone to know that this girl just wasn’t getting enough air. And always wondered how can others do it, i just can’t.  \nToo often when our child is not doing something that everyone else can do, or does - we are quick to label the child lazy or something else. \n\nIn such cases, it is good to take a step back and see if there actually might be a reason why the child is not doing what should have been really easy.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuEkvgwoDWK/",
    "Question: Don't be lazy\nAnswer: ‘He’s feeling lost’ - that’s what the mother said. \n\nWe had gone to stay at a villa for the weekend with some friends and their kids. When we reached there it was already night so kids had slept. \nNext day morning the adults were sitting at a table outdoors and one of the kids a 5 year old child walked out. He had just woken up. And he was looking here and there.. He was walking slowly and was looking at so many things that were kept.\n\nThe mother of the child immediately said: he’s feeling lost. \nAnd I thought: how do we know? How does we know he’s feeling lost.\n\nMaybe he’s feeling a sense of wonder. A sense of awe at the beautiful place he is in. We don’t know.\n\nThe reason I am sharing this is that a lot of times we try to guess what is going on in our child’s mind. Just that we don’t think we are guessing. We are sure we know what is going on in our child’s mind. \n\nAnd we base our actions toward the child on that. But the truth is we don’t know. \n\nWe don’t know if the child is feeling lost or if the child is feeling a sense of wonder. The solution to this is to take a step back and observe rather than conclude. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuJuDimoX6I/",
    "Question: Guessing our child's mind all the time\nAnswer: Is your child being unreasonable? \n\nHe does not sit and eat at all. Keeps roaming all the time. Not even sitting to study. And always wants to be next to you. Always wants mumma, dadda. He keeps hitting to ask for things.\nWe often expect young children to be able to manage their emotions or speak to us calmly. Or be able to sit. \n\nAnd when this does not happen we feel frustrated. \nThe question that as a parent I have found useful to ask is: is my child being unreasonable or are my expectations unrealistic? \n\nBecause the brain of the child is still developing, a lot of these things are something the child will learn. And they will learn by observing others, doing social interactions. \n\nThe funny part is that if we expect them to be born already knowing how to manage their own emotion, that can cause us to lose our temper which is then what the child actually learns. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuO3lm8OOrh/",
    "Question: Unreasonable child?\nAnswer: Chote bache jhooth nahin bolte. \n\nThat is one big reason why bonding with your child is better when the child is young.\n\nBecause they don't lie. They tell you the truth.\n When the child gets bigger, 10-12 years, becomes a teenager even talking is harder coz half the time you don't know if they are telling you the right reason for something or not. And that makes bonding harder. \nYoung kids will say what comes to their minds. \n\nAnd if at that time if we can observe our child deeply, we can form a bond that can last a lifetime.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuReMnjoOnI/",
    "Question: Why bonding is better when child is young?\nAnswer: The real role of the nanny is not to let the child die. \nTo keep the child safe. \nIt is not to help the child\nNanny exists because the parent is busy. But this role quickly evolves into the nanny doing everything for the child - from putting clothes, to feeding food, to walking just 1 m behind them, to doing everything that is the whim and fancy of the child. \n\nAnd that is BAD for our child because then the child does not develop the skills to do work themselves. \nSo if you have a nanny: tell her - just keep my child safe. And don’t do any work for him unless he really really needs help.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuUBKgLIDjd/",
    "Question: Role of Nanny\nAnswer: What is the one thing we should never do as a parent\nA little girl had come to play in our house. When her mother came to get her, she didn't want to go. So the mother said: you come or I am going and I will close the door. \nTaking away your love from the child is probably the worst thing we can do to our children. To say to them that our love for them is conditional. Conditional of good behaviour. Behaviour as defined by the adult. \nThere are multiple other simpler ways to get a child to listen to what you are saying. From bending down on your knees, to looking into her eyes, to holding her hand - all these are ways to connect with the child. Rather than threaten, disconnect and shutting the door.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuWmKwEN5kM/",
    "Question: One thing to never do as a parent\nAnswer: Making this simple change can reduce 90% of your battles with your child\n. \nWe were two couples. We have one kid each and we were on a road trip. So we were taking turns to drive. \n\nIt was my friends turn to drive and his 5 year old daughter said: papa you sit with me: you don’t drive. \nSo my friend said: arey but I have to drive. And she said: no you sit with me. And he said: baba it’s my turn to drive. And she said: no no I want you to sit with me\n\nBecause I was standing next to them I said to the child: so you want your dad to sit with you. Right?\nShe nodded\nAnd I said: You like sitting with him na\nShe nodded\nAnd I said, great he has to drive for 1 hour and then he will sit with you only. Ok?\nShe nodded and climbed inside the car\nThe point I wanted to make was that too often the thing we miss doing in our interaction with the child is ‘acknowledging our child’s emotion’. \n\nWe are quick to teach, quick to share our point of view and make it into a struggle whereas the only thing child is looking for is has the adult heard what I said. The child only wants to feel understood.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cubwb7zIzxB/",
    "Question: Simple change to become a better parent\nAnswer: Aap apne bachey ke saath maths karne baithe hai. Aur woh sum solve kar raha hai. \n\nAap dekh rahe hai. Jaise jaise woh likh raha hai, aapke mooh se bhi unconsciously aawaaz aa rahi hai. \n\nHmm Hmmm\n\nThoda bhi idher uder galat to aawaaz change. Hmmm\nTo aapka kya lagta hai - bachey ke chote se dimaag ka dhayaan maths seekhne pe hai ya ispe hai ke papa ke mooh se kaunsi aawaaz niklegi uska continuous tension hai? \n\nYeh khali maths mein nahin hota. Bahut saare parents yeh unconsciously most of the time karte hai. \n\nAur jis ghar mein yeh hota hai, wahan pe bachey ka focus seekhne pe ya kuch khud se behtar karne mein nahin hota. Woh focus change ho jaata hai mata pita ki approval lene mein. Aur seekhna choot jaaata hai. \n\nA lot of us do this when we say to our child ya good, very good. But the most hard to change are the unconscious ones, the ones that we do when our child has done we feel is right. The voice that comes automatically from within us to which the child gets attached and trapped!\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cug5tDaoDPh/",
    "Question: Stamp of Approval\nAnswer: A common mistake parents make is this. \nWe spend far more time as parents thinking about \nhow our kids look\nrather than \nhow our kids feel. \n\nWhatever bond/connection we have with them, we use it to ensure they brush their teeth, wear the right clothes, comb their hair, that they are looking like a 'Good kid'.\n\nWe focus too much on developing the outward and forget the inward. \nAs a parent next time when you are with your child and want to say something to them - think if the conversation you are going to have - is it about how the child looks or how the child feels?\n\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CujefIwoyH5/",
    "Question: A common mistake parents make\nAnswer: Here’s something to think about.\nWhen your child is young and clinging to you, we want the child to be away. \n\nWhen the same child is a teenager and does not want spend time with us, we want him to be close. \nSo the question is: where is the problem? With the child’s perspective or with the parents?\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CumDDa5oyGO/",
    "Question: Self reflection\nAnswer: Ek 9 aur 6 saal ke bachon ki ma ne yeh likha ke yeh bachey meri sun hi nahin rahe hia. Mobile chodte hi nahin hai. Mein keh keh ke thak gayi hui. Ab to mujhe bhi ulta seedha bol rahe hai. Mein kya karoon? \nNow this is a difficult situation. \n\nKyonki jabb aapko lagta hai ke aap kuch kar nahin sakte. Jab aapke bachon ko pata hai aap kuch nahin karoge. Jabb aapne pehle apne sukh ke liye bachon ko mobile dekhne diye aur jab mana karna tha, tab nahin kiya, to ab mushkil hai. \nWhat cannot work ever as a parent is having a helpless stance: what can I do? \n\nMein kya kar sakti hoon? Meri sunte nahin hai. \n\nKyonki bachon ki mental and physical health ka dhayaan rakhna  is the bare minimum job we have as a parent.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuovGVUohpR/",
    "Question: Bare minimum job of the parent\nAnswer: They locked the kid in a dark room and told him that he will get chilli in his mouth. \n\nA curious person who is not a parent herself wrote to me after having witnessed this. \nShe said she witnessed parent of a specially abled child saying this to her child that I will put you in a dark room and put chilli in your mouth bcz the child was not listening to the parent. \n\nThe girl who wrote to me asked: that what sort of personality traits such children develop as they grow up.\n\nWhen I heard her I wanted to somehow jump into the screen and come out wherever this child is, where her parents are and find a way to help. \nA child’s brain wants an environment of safety and love. And when they don't get it our child's brain adapts to keep him safe. This could mean the child will both love and hate the parent which is very confusing. The child can become quiet. The child can be fearful of humans. Because of what the child is going through any big or small deviations happen which can last a lifetime.\n\nSuch parents exist. \n\nMost of us are not in this category but if you see something of this is sort happening don’t stand-by. Do something. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CurMTfguawE/",
    "Question: Locking the kid in a dark room\nAnswer: Think about this conflicting thought.\n\nA child in a slow class in school says: I am bored\nA child who finished watching a cartoon will also say after that: I am bored\nThe child says the same thing: I am bored in these two situations which are so different: the monotonous class and the lively cartoon. \n\nWhy is that?\n\nBecause in both cases our child’s mind is not being used. In the first case the child’s mind is under stimulated and in the second one it is over stimulated. \nBut in both cases it is not being used. And the child says: I am bored.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CutxPAbIXpU/",
    "Question: What do you do when your child says 'I am bored'?\nAnswer: A no means a no. \nA 7-year-old called me from her mothers phone. She said: happy uncle, my dad wants to kiss me, I don’t like that. I am saying no but he is not listening. He is still kissing me. \nAs she said this I was reminded of my own daughter saying to me: dadda, don’t kiss me. She even wrote a message and put it on my desk – she said: dadda I hate your kisses but I love your hugs. \nAnd after that day I did not kiss my daughter without asking her first. \nThis is something that I wish every parent, every father, every mother understood. That a no means a no. \nThis is required because 90% of cases of molestation happen by people who the girl or boy know in the family. And it is important for the child to know that their ‘saying no’ matters.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cu4Dt5uuRJt/",
    "Question: A no means a no. \nAnswer: I am feeling afraid. This is what a lot of parents who have seen this video, they have felt and they have written to ask, what can I do to help my child respond to a situation like this? I think firstly, we can calm ourselves down by knowing that this is not what happens in a preschool every day or everywhere.\n\nSecondly, I genuinely think we can't do much to prepare a toddler to face a situation like this. But here is what we can do. We can be the kind of parent who notices any negative change of behavior in our child and response to it. We can be the kind of parent who our child believes, listens to me, and hence they share what is happening with us.\n\nAnd finally, we can go and make a habit of checking the CCTV camera of the school once a month. This will calm our mind and it'll also help us catch if something is not going right. Also, you might have noticed in the videos that there are kids standing against the door and the window, like they want to get out of that place.\n\nSo what we can do is stop sending our children to schools which look like jails. And if we let things be, things will remain like this. But if we demand change, change can happen and we can ask for schools, where there is space for a child to play and for a child to be, that is the kind of schools we want.\n\nAnd it can only happen if we ask for them.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuHIbz9IRYr/",
    "Question: I am feeling afraid\nAnswer: There is this one thing which is really good about our Cbse state board education system. And that is that it makes our child work hard. From one period to another,  📍 from one subject to another. From so many tests that happen, the child has no option but to work hard in school. And I think this is one big reason why so many CEOs of global companies are Indian, but all of this comes at a cost.\n\nWhat is that cost? That cost is taking away the sense of agency of a child. What is a sense of agency? Sense of agency is the feeling that I am in control of my life and in this busy school where everything is set, this feeling gets taken away. Now the international boards: IGCSE or IB, Montessori, Waldorf, they give more freedom to the child.\n\nBut what also happens in a lot of these schools as they're evolving is that they forget to make the child work hard. And both of these things, the feeling of a sense of agency, the feeling that I can do what I want to do. And I can put in the hard work required to achieve it are important to have a happy adult, to have a confident adult. And this is where the role of parenting becomes important to choose the right school, the right board for a child to have both a sense of agency and the ability to do hard work.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cu1hGvItod9/",
    "Question: One good thing about CBSE/State boards\nAnswer: I was chatting with a friend who has a 4 year old and he was feeling that he doesn't get enough time to spend with his child. \nHe has his job and also spends 5 hours/week on a project that he has taken up. In his mind the project is a small thing that he is doing on the side. \nTo which I disagreed. \n5 hours a week = half a working day/week\nhalf a working day/week = 2 working days/month\n2 working days/month = 24 working days/year\nWhich essentially = 1 month out of the 12 months we have in an year. \nTime compounds. \nAnd most of us have limited mental bandwidth. \nSo this side project is not a side project. But is actually taking 1 month out of 12 months of time in an year. A time that he can use in spending with his child, pursuing a hobby or doing something that will really matter to him in the long run.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cu6pL_zIRy4/",
    "Question: Do you feel you don't get enough time with your child?\nAnswer: Who used the washroom? This is the question the mother asked the 3 kids. \nOur friend from Ahemadabad was visiting us with her daughters. So all the 3 kids were sitting in a room playing when the mother came in and asked: who used the washroom? You haven't flushed. \nNobody said yes. So she asked the kids one by one: did you use it, did you use it, did you use it. Nobody said yes. \nI was listening and wondering what might be an alternate way to do this because these are children 5,7 and 9 year old. It is possible one of the kids might have forgotten to flush. It is possible they themselves don't remember it. It is possible they remember it but now if they admit, they know they will be shamed. \nSo an alternate way to do it is: Hi playing kids, listen, I just saw the flush wasn't flushed. Somebody went susu and forgot. So please remember to flush it next time. Ok! Love you. \nBecause what we want to do is emphasize not on the guilt but what needs to be done the next time.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cu9OBEBI9qv/",
    "Question: Who used the washroom and didn’t flush?\nAnswer: What does luxury mean for kids?\nA mom went to a place which I had recommended to go with kids. And after her trip she messaged me to say that they could not book the AC cabins to stay in and they had to stay in a simple tent with shared bathrooms.  \n\nShe said so they put their things in the small tent, went swimming in the lake in the evening then took a bath in the common shower which is open from the top. Then there was simple food and at night 3 of them slept in the tent where the daughter spent time deciding who will sleep how.\n\nOn the way back home, her daughter who is 7 said: mumma the camp left no stone unturned in giving us a luxury experience. \n\nAnd her mom said she was shocked when she heard that. Because for the mom the idea of luxury was the AC cabin, having a spa, a buffett to eat but for the daughter, being together in the tent, swimming in the lake, seeing stars while taking a bath, eating curd and rice is what counted as luxury. \n\nThe adult idea of luxury is driven by the ads that we have seen too many of.  And that is an idea we don’t need to give to our kids. Because for kids – having time with family, having an open place to run, some nature to play is all that counts as luxury. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cu_zGIlN7q4/",
    "Question: What does luxury mean for kids?\nAnswer: Just now in the room next to me you know what is happening. My daughter is sitting with her aajhi, her naani and she is writing hindi. Both doing it joyfully. \nHer aajhi is saying names of different members of the family and their relationships with my daughter and she is sitting over a copy and writing them down. No pressure to write, no coercion to write. \nNo saying to the child - if you don’t do this, then you can’t go to play. \nNo saying to the child -  you have to do 30 min of writing today.\nThis is something that I am personally really happy about. I know many of us feel that it is not possible to teach children without force, without making them sit. But that is not true. \nChildren feel the need to be learn things that are useful in society. Because the child wants to be part of what adults, what society is doing. Writing is useful in daily life, reading is useful in daily life and if we can wait the child will come to us to learn it. \nI think that it is possible for every child in the world to learn joyfully - without them feeling that what they are doing is forced on them. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvE8rhxIz_J/",
    "Question: Is it possible for children to learn joyfully?\nAnswer: A 13 year old girl put insecticide powder in sugar container in her house to try to kill her parents. She also spilled cleaning liquid on bathroom floor hoping that her parents will slip. \nBut why will a child do that to her own parents?\nBecause her mother had taken away her mobile phone. The 13 year old girl was spending long hours at night watching the phone or chatting with friends. So her mother took away the phone. Which is why the teenager tried to kill her parents. \nYou know what I learnt from this. That if you take away mobile from a 2 year old, he will be ok in a day. If you try and take mobile away from a 5 year old, he will be ok in a week. If you try to take it away from a 10 year old, he might hit you, stop talking to you but will be ok in a month. But if you try to take it from a teenager, he might try to kill you. This is how bad addiction of mobile can be. \nSo prevention is better than cure. Don’t let this habit of mobile form. And if it has formed in your house, break it today rather than tomorrow. Don’t wait for it to hit teenager years. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvHgucdNgDy/",
    "Question: Why did a 13 year old girl plotted to kill her parents?\nAnswer: Ghar jaa ke yaar shaam ka poora agenda hota hai. Garden se upar laana hai, nehlana hai, khana khilana hai, sulana hai. Ek dum set schedule hai.\nMeri ek dost jo ke start-up mein kaam karti hai aur uski 5 saal ke beti hai, usne yeh bataya. Ke office mein bhi full busy aur ghar jaa ke full busy agenda taaki sabb manage ho sake. \nTo maine usko bola yaar, yeh to bahut galat lag raha hai, mere khayaal se Baaki sab to hota rahega lekin ghar jaa ke ek hi agenda hona chahiye: ke poore din ke baad mujhe mere bachey se milna hai. I want to meet my child, give them a hug, a smile and look into their eyes. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvKGPgXN_XP/",
    "Question: Agenda waali zindagi\nAnswer: My daughter got these new coloured balls, 6 of them. And her friends wanted to play with it. So they picked it. I was around and I saw that she took the balls back from everyone and said hey you take this colour, you take that colour. \n\nMy first instinct was: why are you doing that, why are you trying to control. \n\nBut I was talking to my psychologist friend Nupur about it and she mentioned the why question comes from a place of judgement where we have already decided that our child has done something wrong. Like why are you doing this? It also shows in our emotion.\n\nIf we can replace the why question with the what question which is: I saw this. I wanted to know what were you thinking?\n\nthen we can actually know what the child was thinking and find more connection. Because what we are looking to do is seeking to understand. And btw this works not only with children. Replacing the ‘why are you doing this’ question ‘what are you thinking’ works with adults as well and can improve our relationship 😊\n\nIf you replace the ‘why’ questions with ‘what’ questions our relationship with our child can improve. Let me take an example.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvMqflKt4Np/",
    "Question: Understanding our child\nAnswer: Have you heard of a Bonsai? It is the Japanese art of growing beautiful looking varieties of trees and shrubs in pots. It takes a lot of hard work to grow a bonsai. Lot of techniques, pruning, leaf trimming have to be used to train a tree to stay small and live inside a pot. \nBut what has this got to do with children?\nI sometimes wonder if our education system has become like that. \nTrying to teach our children various methods, trying to impart knowledge using different techniques, shaping how the child should think, what subjects should he learn. Putting in so much effort in trying to train our child’s mind. \nAnd thinking of it as a developed educated child but in reality, preventing our child from growing to their full potential. And making a bonsai out of our children.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvRzcV1owoL/",
    "Question: Unlearning from a Japanese art\nAnswer: Has a child asked for a new toy or Are we just hearing what we want to hear? You know, my daughter is learning to wave board. Actually. I think she's learning in her mind. I think she's playing right and having fun. But she's been on the wave board all the time. She goes from the house to the lift in the wave board and the lift, she's on the wave board and she comes out on the wave board.\n\nThen she'll keep her wave board somewhere, then go everywhere, only wave boarding. So there's only wave board going on. Right? And you know, a few days ago she said to me, Dad, you know, I have level one wave board and my friend, she has a level three wave board. So I listened. I said, yeah, okay. And I kept quiet. I didn't say anything.\n\nIt has taken me a lot of practice to remain quiet. If it was only a year ago, I would've said, oh, do you want the level three wave board? I'll get it for you. You know, thinking I should get the wave board for her. But most often, The child is only sharing a fact, and it is adults who are interpreting it as a wish of buying another toy or another thing.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvW9ctJtH8P/",
    "Question: Buying new toys\nAnswer: If you are seeing any behaviour in your child that you don’t understand here are four questions you need to ask yourself before doing anything else\nQuestion 1: Is my child’s screen time <30 min/day\nQuestion 2: Does my child get >2 hours/day outdoors\nQuestion 3: Is my child sleeping 11-14 hours/day\nQuestion 4: Do I feel I get enough time with my child everyday \nEven for a plant to grow we need sunlight, water, nutrients and right temperature. Similarly for a child to grow up well these 4 things I mentioned are required. And if all 4 are happening and still there is something you feel is off, that is a good place to start trying to understand our child. But first it is imp to check that the child is getting less screen, more outdoor time, good sleep and time with parents before doing anything else.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvZjHiJNYme/",
    "Question: Are you unable to understand your child?\nAnswer: A 6 year old boy was tied and beaten on his legs with a rod by a doctor. \nThis did not happen yesterday. This happened 34 years ago. My 40year old friend who went to IIT with me shared this. \nHe said his father was in the bank and his family kept shifting cities. So when he joined a new school on the first day the teacher slapped another child. He got scared. And from next day refused to go back to school. First he said he had fever, then after a few days he said he has stomach ache, then after few days he said he headache. By now the parents had almost decided that he was lying. So he decided to sneeze. And he sneezed and sneezed so that parents don’t send him to school. Parents took him to doctor but no doctor could find anything. After 3-4 days my friend realised he could not stop sneezing. And he got scared. Finally one doctor said: either today I will find a way to stop this or I will stop being a doctor. So he tied him to the bed and used wires to check that connection of the nose, ear, throat everything is ok. It was all ok. So finally he took a rod and started hitting my friend’s legs. And in two minutes his sneezing had gone. The connection in the brain had been broken. \nThe reason I am sharing this for us as parents to understand that KIDS LIE. It is normal. This does not make the child a bad person or a kid with psychological disorder. My friend went to IIT and the lying kid is a super nice, smart, warm and successful person in the corporate world today. \nIn most cases lying happens because the child is afraid of something. And I think our best chance as parents is to ask them this question: is there anything you are afraid of, can you tell me? I promise you; I will take care of it.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cves6SQIcix/",
    "Question: Why was a 6 year old boy was tied and beaten by doctor?\nAnswer: It can be irritating when a child asks us to do something which they can do themselves. When a child asks you to do something that they can already do, like get me my water bottle or can you get me this from the other room. \n\nIt is a mix of things that is happening: two things actually -  \nthey are asking for love, knowing that you care and \nthey are being a little bit lazy\nSo this is what I do: If it is just the start of the day or the end of a long day, I will smile and do it and give my daughter a kiss on the head because I believe what she is looking for is some love. \nIf it is during the day and she's been say sitting on the sofa and asking, I believe it is partly because of love and the rest coz of laziness, so I will look at her and smile and say: you can get it yourself, or I will go over to her, and tickle her and say: oye this you can do yourself, I know that. \nHopefully fulfilling both the need for connection and getting the child to move and do their work themselves.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvhRX9_tWrB/",
    "Question: Dad, can you do this for me?\nAnswer: I see screen for eight, 10 hours a day. I work on my laptop. I do everything. Why can't my child do it? I hear this argument normally from parents of older children. You know, you can't do this because a child's brain is still developing till the age of 24. So as adults, we can spend long hours and still be okay, but for a child to do that, the brain stops developing and the physical activity and everything else that is required for the brain to develop, it goes missing.\n\nThis is why rules for adults and children need to be different.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cvj7JFmNo4v/",
    "Question: I see screens for 8h. Why can't my child see screens?\nAnswer: I was sitting next to an an 8 year old. And I asked her: Why do you go to school? \nYou know what she said. She said: I go to school so that my mother does not delete the Roblox app from the phone. This was the reason she went to school.\n\nAnd I was wondering that is this child learning in school? School is 50% of the waking time of the child? So is the school an enjoyable experience for the child or is it something the child feels they are being forced to go? Will this child become a lifelong learner or will this child start to hate school and learning.\nThe reason I am sharing this is for you as a parent to ask this question: why is your child going to school? Is she enjoying going to school or is there another reason? \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cvo_15MtJrs/",
    "Question: Do you know why your child goes to school?\nAnswer: Bachon pe label lagana aasaan hai, nikaalna mushkil. \nKabhi aapne sticker lagaya hai kissi cheez pe. Laga dena to bahut aasaan lekin nikalne jao to bahut mushkil. Poora nikalta nahin hai. Kuch na kuch reh jaata hai. \nAise hi bachon pe label lagana aasaan hai, mera bacha shy hai, sharmila hai, arey yeh naughty hai bahut, yeh aisa hi hai. Kehna bahut aasaan. Lekin baad mein bachey ke dimaag se nikalna bahut mushkil. \nTo behtar yeh to ke ho sake to sharmila hone ka, naughty hone ka, smart hone ka, koi bhi sticker apne bachey par na lagayein. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cvrkac0tY1j/",
    "Question: Bacchon pe sticker\nAnswer: A simple thing for busy parents to increase connection with the child: \nOne of our couple friends have done an interesting thing. They are both working, and they have one daughter 6 years old. They have a nanny who helps pick up the daughter after school and take care till they come back. But they have done something simple to increase connection with the child: \nThey have put a landline phone in the house. \nSo now their 6 year old daughter does not need to ask the nanny to call their mom dad. When she feels like talking to their mom dad, she can just pick up the landline and call. This suddenly can give a young child so much more power, feel so much more in control of their life. Otherwise to even talk to her mom dad she has to ask her nanny. \nAnd what has also happened is that she is now using the phone to call her naani and daadi and talking to them which otherwise was so difficult to do through a video call or on a phone call when parents came back from work. Or happened only on weekends. \nAnd I thought putting a landline was such a simple but wonderful idea to increase connection with the child in a family with working parents. parents. \n--\nDescription: For safety another thing they have done is they haven’t given this phone number out anywhere else except family so that no outsider has access to this phone line. \n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvwuDNEo1hR/",
    "Question: A simple thing for busy parents to increase connection with the child\n\nAnswer: A lot of parents ask: Do I need to send my child school till age 6. \nOne clear answer for that is: No. You don’t need to send your child to school.\nBut and this is an imp but if at home you don't have the time, you live in an apartment with no access to outdoors, and if not going to school means watching more TV for the child, then yes – you should send your child to school\nThe reason I am sharing this is that in case of children there are rarely clear yes and no answers. And there are always a lot of questions one can ask around children. And the only way to find the answer that is right for you is to ‘understand the child’. That ways once we understand what is the need of a young child we can easily understand which path to take\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvzSr6ao2SJ/",
    "Question: Do I need to send my child school before age 6? \nAnswer: A mother shared this Heart warming morning routine. She said that when she wakes up her child in the morning, once of once or twice in a week, she just picks her up and puts her in her lap. And she tells her you know when you were born you were so little, you could come in my arms, then you became this big and you could fit in my lap, then when you were 4, your toes started to come out of my lap and now look at you, I am trying to fit you in my lap and I can't. \nAnd her daughter keeps giggling all the while while hearing this and in the end she is waiting to stretch fully to show her mother how tall she has become. \nAs the parent was telling me this, I realised that is such a wonderful way to connect with your child in the morning and make yourself and them feel loved before the madness of the day takes over.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv13ZzpNw5K/",
    "Question: Heart warming morning routine\nAnswer: “I have to teach my child to pee without spilling”\nA mother wrote this to me. This she said was the next thing she wanted to teach her child. \nAs I was reading it I thought how attached we become to our responsibility as parents. How seriously we take our parenting jobs that we think that we have to teach our child so many things that actually will automatically happen as the child grows. \nBecause every child wants to learn themselves. ‘I can do it myself’ is a confidence every child wants to have. So at some point the child will get the coordination required to not spill.\nBut the real reason pee spilling is happening is because we have created this artificial thing/place within the house for peeing. It didn’t use to happen earlier when we used to live in jungles. \nSo, what the parent might be better off doing is teaching a child how to clean rather than how to pee. Because I can't think of a better way for a child to learn how to pee in the pot than a child who must help to clean afterwards.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv7BPhRNts_/",
    "Question: Pee in a pot\nAnswer: All of us think there are different kinds of children in this world. Some are naughty, some are smiling. Some want to be outdoors, some want to be indoors. Some throw a tantrum out of everything. And some who, let's say, share everything with everybody. They seem to be different kinds of children. But is that true?\n\nI don't believe that. I think there exists only one kind of child in this world. What is this child? This child is the child absorbed in work without need of praise, reward, or fear. A child absorbed in work without need of praise, reward, or fear. This is the only kind of child that exists. Because when a child is absorbed in work, all defects vanish. All children are the same, but this child is vanishing from this earth.\n\nWhy is this child vanishing? Because our world has become too noisy. Mobile. Cartoon. Chocolates. Praise. Good. Very good. All of this has enveloped the child. So if there's one thing that we could do as a parent for our children, is to help the child discover their inner one kind of child without letting the world distract him or her.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv9n6iToGj3/",
    "Question: One kind of child\nAnswer: You know, when a child goes to tuitions, here is what happens. The child knows I have to go to a tuition, so the child stops listening in school. The teacher knows the child is going to a tuition, so the teacher stops teaching in school. And a cycle forms where everybody is in sync, where the child knows I don't have to learn at school.\n\nAnd a teacher knows they don't have to teach. And this is a dangerous cycle. But this cycle cannot break till the parents take some action. Till the time we don't go to the school and ask, why does my child need to take a tuition for maths?\n\nEven children as young as in second class, third class. Why do I need to send them to a tuition when they're coming to school for learning? The change has to start with the parent asking this question to schools that our children go to.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwAPOcwssHX/",
    "Question: Does your child go to a tuition?\nAnswer: \n    \n    Sann 1897 mein ek Russian scienties Ivan Pavlov ne ek bahut imp research publish ki. Unko apni research ke liye 1904 mein noble puraskaar bhi mila. Kya thi yeh research aur uska hamare bachon ko mobile dikha kar khana khilane se kya lena dena hai? Gaur se sunenge to bahut lena dena hai.\n    \n    Aaj kall har bacha khana khata hai. Kyonki mobile dikhate dikhate kissi bhi bachey ko kitna bhi khana khilaya jaa sakta hai. Aur Ma, Daadi sab khush hai. Kyonki bacha bina shaitani kiye, bina nakhre kiye, bass khata jaa raha hai. Tandurust banega, bada jaldi hoga. Ab ismein kya galat ho sakta hai?\n    \n    Sirf ek gadbad hai. Humein apne bachey ke tann ko do dekh liya, uske liye khana khila diya. Lekin uske man ko bhool gaye. Woh tann jo dikhta hai, woh bad raha hai.  Parr woh mann jo dikhta nahin hai, uska is tarah khana khilane se kya haal hua?\n    \n    Kya aapko pata hai humein bhookh kaise lagti haI? Mere ek mitr jo har roz walk pe jaate hai, unhone notice kiya ke pichley 10 din se woh walk karne ke baad zyada khane lage hai. Unko pehle to samaj mein nahin aaya kyon. Bahut sochne par unko samaj aaya ke unke chalne ke raste mein nayi market khul gayi thi jismein se khane ka smell har roz aana shuru hua. Woh smell se unka zyada khane ka dil karne laga.\n    \n    Jab pet khali hota hai, ya humein kahin khane ki khusboo aati hai, ya hamari aakhein kuch aisa dekhti hai jo humein swadisht lagta hai to man ko signal jaata hai ke khao. Aur khane ke vichaar hamare mann mein aate hai.\n    \n    Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov ki jis research ke liye unko noble prize mila uska hamare bachon ke mann se bahut tallok hai. Scientist Ivan Pavlov ne yeh research kutton pe ki. Unhone yeh dekha ke khana khane se pehle hi kutton ke muh mein paani aata hai. Isse hum saliva kehte hai. Aur woh is baat ko vaigyaan se prove karna chah rahe the. Uske liye unhone ek choti si tube kutton ke muh mein daal di. Is test tube mein saliva ikatha hota hai. Lekin unhone jab dhayan diya to pata laga ke kutte ko khana dene waale ke footsteps sunte hi saliva aana shuru ho jaata tha. Matlab bina khana dekhe hi unka mann kutton ko saliva banane ke liye bol deta tha. Ivan Pavlov ne phir ek aur experiment kiya: unhone ek ghanti li aur ab khana dene se kuch der pehle har roz woh ghanti bajani shuru ki. Shuru mein kuch nahin hua lekin kuch dinon mein sirf ghanti bajane par hi kutton ke moh mein saliva aane laga.\n    \n    Matlab kya hua? What happened here? Yeh hua ke kutton ke mann ab train ho chuka tha, ke ghanti sunte hi humein khana milega, humein bhookh lagegi, yeh unke mann mein bas gaya. Is research ke liye Ivan Pavlov ko noble puraskar mila.\n    \n    Is research ko naam diya gaya 'classical conditioning'. Aur kutte ke response ko kaha gaya 'conditioned reflex'.\n    \n    Yehi hum apne bachon ke saath kar rahe hai. Unko aaj hum khana khila rahe hai mobile dikha kar, cartoon dikha kar. Unke dimaag ko hum train kar rahe hai, ke jab bhi khana khana ho to unka man bole arey mujhe TV chahiye. Shayad yeh bhi ke jabb bhi woh TV dekhein unka dimaag bole khao. Bhookh lagi ho ya na lagi ho, dimaag bolega khao.\n    \n    Mobile dekhte hue khane se over eating hoti hai. Hum zaroorat se zyada khate hai.\n    \n    Sochiye hamara bacha bada ho gaya hai, usne khane ki plate uthayi, ya chips ke packet uthaye aur TV on kar diya. Aur woh bina soche samjhe ab chabata chala gaya. Kya hoga aise bachey ke tann ko aur mann ko bada ho ke. Kitna unhealthy hoga. Yeh mann ki training hum usmein paida kar rahe hai aaj usko mobile dikha ke aur khana khila ke.\n    \n    Mere ek dost ghoomne gaye the apne bete ke saath. Wahan pe unka mobile band ho gaya. To jab khana khane ke baat aayi, to unke bete ne pita se bola. Arey mobile hi nahin hai, mein khana kaise khaaoonga. Mein khana nahin kha sakta. Mere dost ko us din pehli baar ahsaas hua ke unhone kya kar diya hai. Mann mein kya sambandh bana diya hai.\n    \n    Yeh sambandh todna hamare haath mein hai. Yeh hum rok sakte hai.\n    \n    Bahut baar khana hum bachey ko isliye khilate hai kyonki humein lagta hai ke unko bhookh lag rahi hogi. Ya humein lagta hai ke din mein teen baar to khana hi chahiye. Parantu hum sab ki bodies aur bhook different hoti hai. Sirf hum khud hi bata sakte hai ke kitna khana hum khana chahate hai. Kab khana chahate hai. Bachey samajdaar hote hai. Unko pata hai unko kab bhookh lagti hai. Ek saal ka bacha bhi jab maa ka dhoodh pi raha hota hai to utna hi peeta hai jitna zaroorat hai. 3 saal se chote bachey khelne mein vayasth ho gaye, bhool gaye to thoda ro ke bata denge. Aap khila dena jitna woh khana chahe.\n    \n    Agar aapke ghar pe abhi mobile dikha ke khana khilane ki aadat padi hui hai to ho sakta hai ke aapka pehla hafta mushkil jaye. Bacha royega kyonki usko aadat pad chuki hai. Lekin ek baar usko samaj mein aa gaya ke mobile nahin milne waala hai to rona band ho jayega. Bacha shayad khana khane se mana kar de. Kuch nahin hota. Aap usko bola - beta hum samajte hai. Yeh aapke liye khana rakha hai, jab bhi khana ho kha sakte ho.\n    \n    Aapne agar aapne ek hafta nikaal diya, to bachey ka vyavahaar badar jayega. Woh zid karna chor dega aur aap safal ho jayenge.\n    \n    Is sab mein mein yeh nahin keh raha hoon ke mobile phone ya TV dikhana bilkul band kar dena chahiye. Yeh aaj kal ke zamane mein mushkil hai. Lekin mobile phone ke saath khana khilana band kar dena chahiye.\n    \n    Jabb bhi mein kissi maa baap ko apne bachey ko mobile ke saath khana khilate hue dekhta hoon to mujhe Sholay movie ka gabbar ka dialogue yaad aata, 'basanti jab tak tumhare pair chalenge, iski saans chalegi'. Yehi hum kar rahe hai, ke jabb tak mooh chalega, to video chalega, chahe overeating ho jaaye. Sholay movie mein to Jai ko bachaane Veeru aa gaya tha, lekin yahaan pe yeh kaam aapko hi karna hai.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CvPPa00I-c6/",
    "Question: \nMobile dikhao, khana khilao | Understanding mobile addiction in kids while eating\nAnswer: “We want to raise our kids like dogs”\n\nHum apne bache ko kutton ki tarah paalna chahate hai. \n\nYeh woh line thi jiske karan mera parenting aur bachon ko samajne mein interest shuru hua. Yeh line kahi the AS Neil ne jo ke Summerhill school ke founder hai. Summerhill school Britain ka 100 saal purana free school hai. Aisa school jahan bachey apne man se padtey hai jo unka dil ho. \n\nAS Neil ne kaha ke zyadatar parents apne bachon ke saath waise hi vyahawaar karte hai jaise ke dogs ke saath karte hai. Idher aao, baith jao, khana khao. Parr hamara aspiration hona chahiye ke hamare bachey billi ki tarah bane. Khud se khush rahe aur jo man mein ho waisa karein. \n\nMujhe nahin pata ke aap is baat se agree karte hai ke nahin. Lekin is baat se mein agree karta hoon ke hum mein se bahut saare logon ka bachey ki karaf nazariya respect ka nahin hai. \n\nHum bachon se bade hai isliye hum bachey ko dogs ki tarah order de sakte hai. Baith jao, Toys jagah pe rakho, khana theek se khao. Jacket pehno chalo. Come here, brush your teeth.\n\nTo aisa order dene ka nuksaan kya hai. Sonya Philip jo ke Learning Mindsets ki founder hai, she says jab hum aise command de ke bachon se baat karte hai to unke paas do option bach jaate hai\n\n- maano\n- ya na maano\n\nAur harr human ka natural reaction hai push back karna. Kissi ko ‘controlled’ feel hona aacha nahin lagta. To order waali language use karke hum almost bachon ko invite kar rahe hai hamara kehna na maan ne ke liye. \n\nAur harr human ka natural reaction hai push back karna. Kissi ko ‘controlled’ feel hona aacha nahin lagta. To order waali language use karke hum almost bachon ko invite kar rahe hai hamara kehna na maan ne ke liye. \n\nIsko change karne ka tareeka bahut simple hai. Humein sirf apne ‘order’ ko ‘fact’ mein badalna hai. Waise baat karni hai jaise hum kissi se karenge jiski hum equally respect karte hai. \n\n- Yeh kehne ki jagah ke ‘jacket pehno’ hum keh sakte hai ‘bahar thand hai. jacket will keep you warm’\n- Yeh kehne ki jagah ‘chalo khana khao’ hum keh sakte hai ‘it’s food time, we are all going to start eating’\n- Yeh kehne ki jagah ‘brush karo’ hum keh sakte hai ‘germs are hiding in your teeth. let’s take them out’\n- Yeh kehne ki jagah ke ‘apne toys uthao’ hum keh sakte hai ke ‘toys belong on the shelves’\n\nYeh ek simple change hai ‘order’ ko ‘fact’ mein badalne ka jo hamara relationship hamare bachon ke saath badal sakta hai. Aap pooch sakte hai ke lekin itna sab karne ki kya zaroorat hai? Pehle hi zindagi nahin sambhal rahi ab yeh dhayaan rakho.\n\nTo jaane se pehle mein aapko ek true story suna deta hoon jo Glennon Doyle ne apne famous novel Untamed mein likhi thi. \n\nUnka beta jab 13 saal ka hua to unhone usko mobile phone allow kiya. And Glennon ne kaha ke agle 2 saal mein usne apni aakhon ke saamne dekha apne bete ko us mobile ke ander jaate hue. Woh ladka jo baith ke desk par poems likhta hai, bahar khelne jaata tha ab online duniya mein busy tha. \n\nUnhein 2 saal lage apne bete se baat karne mein. Ek din unhone apne bete ko saath mein walk karne ke liye kaha. Aur walk pe unhone bete ko bola ke aaj tak maine jo bhi kiya hai yeh soch ke kiya hai ke mujhe tumhare liye sahi karna hai. Lekin pichley 2 saal se mujhe lag raha hai ke mein galat kar rahi hoon. Phone aane ke karan tum change ho gaye ho. Aur mujhe tumse phone waapis lete hue dar lagta hai kyonki tumhare saare doston ke pass phone hai. Lekin mujhe yeh bhi lagta hai ke phone pe kamm time bitana zarrori hai. I know ke long term mein yeh tumhare liye sahi hai. Uska beta thodi der chup raha phir bola - mom maine pada hai ke phone ke karan depression bad raha hai bachon mein. Aur bahut saare artist phone use karna chor rahe hai taaki woh apne kaam pe focus kar sakein. Mujhe bhi lagta hai ke yeh phone mujhe control kar raha hai. \n\nYeh baat hone ke baad dono ne decide kiya social media chorna - ikathe. \n\nYeh kahani phone ki ya social media ki nahin hai. Yeh kahani hai ke ma ne bachey ko yeh nahin bola - tum phone pe chipkey rehte hai, band karo use karna. Usne baat ki aur bete ne samjhi. \n\nAaj bachon ko hamari baat sun ni pad rahi hai. Kall ko woh bada ho jayega to woh aapki baat tabhi sunega agar woh sunna chahate ho. Tab hum order to de nahin payenge lekin pehle agar fact based baat karte aaye ho to conversation zaroor kar lenge, jaise Glennon ne ki. \n\nBachon ko dogs ke tarah bada karna hia ya billiyon ki tarah yeh hum aaj decide kar sakte hai. Fact based conversation kar ke apne bachon se.\n\nMera naam Harpeet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye 5 min bitaye iske liye mein aapka sukhrguzaar hoon. Phir milenge.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cuy6ktpI4lD/",

    "Question: Prashansa ke nuksaan | How to encourage child and avoid praise?\nAnswer: Mera naam Harpreet hai. Aur hum agle 5 min bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nZindagi mein aapke aur aapke bachon ke beech sabse important cheez kya hai. Kya hai jo aap kabhi bhi khona nahin chahenge, chahe kuch bhi ho jaye.\n\nWoh hai bharosa.\n\nJab tak aapko aapke bachon par bharosa hai aur aapke bachon ko aap par tab tak kuch bhi ho jaye aapko pata hai ke aap dono ka relationship, aapka sambandh sahi rahega. Aap ek doosre se kuch bhi baat kar paoge aur sabse zaroori yeh ke aapko lagega ke haan hum ek doosre ke saath hai.\n\nLekin yehi bharosa hum bachon ka har roz todte hai.\n\nKabhi kuch aise cheezon ke liye jo humein bachey ke liye sahi lagti hai,\n\nkabhi kabhi thoda sa apne swarth ke liye\n\naur\n\nkabhi kabhi aise hi bina zyada soche samjhe.\n\nBeta chalo ghar chalo, khelne ka samay khatam ho gaya hai\n\nMujhe aur khelna hai papa\n\nArey beta park band ho raha hai, watchman uncle keh rahe hai sabko\n\nBacha ruk to jaata hai. Aur aap use park se bahar ke aur leke jaana shuru bhi ho jaate ho. Lekin uski nazrein dekh to rahi hai ke baaki bachey to abhi bhi khel rahe hai park mein. Unko to security uncle kuch nahin keh rahe.\n\n**Kabhi kabhi jhotth us samay ke nahin hote. Lekin aage ke promise hote hai.**\n\nMummy ice cream khani hai.\n\nBeta kal khayenge?\n\nAur woh kal tab tak nahin aata kab tak bache ko yaad na aaye.\n\n**Kaafi saare jhooth bachon ki bhalai ke liye hi hote hai.**\n\nPapa phone dekhna hai.\n\nBeta battery khatam ho gayi hai. Tum khud se khelo.\n\nAur 5 min ke baad papa usse phone par dost se baat kar rahe hai.\n\nMummy toffee khani hai\n\nBeta toffee khatam ho gayi hai\n\nLekin bete ko to pata hai ke kaunse dabbe mein chipayi hui hai toffee.\n\n**Iske do nuksaan hai.**\n\nPehla nuksaan yeh hia ke bacha sochta hai ke jhooth bolna ok hai, theek hai. Agar swarth ke liye bolna pade to bol do. To ho sakta hai ke dheere dheere bade hote hue woh aapse aur doosron se aise chote chote jhooth bolna shuru ho jaata hai. Beta kya kar rahe the. Papa mein padai kar raha tha, jabki woh comic pad raha tha. Beta kahan gaye the? Mummy garden gaya tha jabki woh doston ke saath kahin aur hi ghoom raha tha.\n\nYeh pehla nuksaan hai ke humnein bache ko sikha diya ke jhooth bolna theek hai.\n\nDoosra nuksaan isse bhi bada hai. **Woh bharose ka hai.**\n\nKall hum bache ko bolenge, padai kar, tumhare liye jeevan mein achi hai. Bacha sochega kya pata mummy jhooth bol rahi hai.\n\nJab yehi beti badi hogi aur maaniye aap usko bologe, beti yeh ladka theek nahin lag raha, is se shaadi mat kar. To woh sochegi, ke shayad mummy apne swarth ke liye merese jhooth bol rahi hogi. Mein mummy pe bharosa nahin kar sakti.\n\nKyonki woh bharosa humnein bahut saal chote chote jhooth bol kar tod diya hai. Aise jhooth jinko bol kar hamara us waqt to kaam ho gaya par lambey samay mein kaam bigad gaya.\n\n**Lekin karein to kya karein.**  Kyonki yeh jhooth bhi zarrori kisam ke lagte hai. Arey ghar pahunchana hai garden se, roti banani hia, khani hai. Sona hai, subah school jaana hai. Ice cream se toffee se daant kharaab hote hai. Mobile se aakhein kharaab hoti hai.\n\nAb jhooth na bolein to karein kya.\n\n**Sach boliye.**\n\nYeh bolna ke ab ghar jaane ka samay hai. Hamare ghar ka niyam hai ke 7 baje ghar pahunchege. Aur phir pyaar se but mazbooti se bachey ka haath pakad kar ghar ke taraf jaiye.\n\nIce cream nahin kha sakte, toffee nahin kha sakte. Kyonki isse daant kharab hote hai. Yeh junk food hai.\n\nPhone nahin dekh sakte kyonki isse aakhein kharaab hoti hai. Ab rota hai bacha to ronein de. Jab usko pata chala ke rone se mobile nahin milega to chup ho jayega.\n\n**Jhooth bolne aasaan hai. Sach bolna kathin.**\n\nLekin jaise jhooth bolne ke 2 bade nuksaaan hai. **Sach bolne ke 2 bade faayde hai.**\n\nJab hum bache ko wajah batate hai cheezon ki to bachey ka gyaan badta hai, knowledge badti hai. Khud se sochne ki sharamta badti hai.\n\nBacha poochta hai: kyon nahin de rahe, aur humein batana padta hai. Ke toffee mein mitha hota hai, woh tumhare liye aur daanton ke liye aacha nahin hai.\n\nAur doosra faayda bahutu bada hai.\n\nHamari hamare bachey se baat cheet shuru ho jaati hai. Asli baat cheet. Toffee kyon nahin khani chahiye, mobile kyon nahin dekh sakte, ghar jaana kyon zaroori hai. Yeh sab asli baat cheet hai jo chahe us samay thodi mushkil lage lekin lambey samein mein humein bachon ke kareeb le jaati hai.\n\nKitna aacha hai, ke ek chote jhooth ki jagah hum bachey se khule dil se baat kar sakte hai.\n\nBass humein itna dekhna hai ke hamare pass hamare bachon se utni baat karne ka samein ho.\n\nAap parr duniya mein sab se zyada bharosa aapke bachey karte hai. Sabb se zyada.\n\nTo agli baar aap doctor ke pass apne bachey ko injection lagwane ke liye leke jayein aur bacha poochey ke mummy kya dard hoga? To chota sa jhooth bolne ki jagah, **ho sake to sach boliye**. Aur bache ka bharosa khone ki jagah us situation ko bachey se baat karne ke liye istemaal kijiye.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapni mere saath apne bachon ke liye 5 min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukraguzzar hoon. Agar aapko is episode mein kahin baat sahi lagi to aap aur parents, grandparents ke saath isko share kijiye.

    "Question: Bacche ka bharosa | What happens when parents break a child’s trust?\nAnswer: **50 years ago, a dog bit your grandmother.** \n\nSince then, your grandmother got scared, then mother and then you also got scared. If you don’t stop the chain, your children will also get scared. \n\nDo you know why it happens?\n\nBecause we pass on fears to our children.\n\nAll this happens unknowingly. \n\nThere are things that we don’t fear but we make our children fear them.\n\nLike the dark. \n\nAt night we tell them to sleep or else we’ll switch off the lights and ghosts will come. This affects young minds and they probably fear the dark for long time.\n\nFears don’t come from parents alone. \n\nScreens are another medium from which a fear can be born. A child may see the police beating up someone and that can make the child afraid of the police.\n\nIt is normal to have fears. \n\nAll of us are afraid of something or the other.\n\n**Fear is an emotion. There are parts of our brain that signal us to be afraid and help us analyse reality.***\n\nAll these parts are not fully developed in small children. Which is why it is difficult for them to tell which is a real danger. \n\nThis is where we can help children.\n\nWe can listen and acknowledge their fears. \n\nIf we are aware of their fears, we can make a plan to help get rid of their fears. \n\nAnd sometimes, we can let them find their own solution. May be, they can help us to get rid of our own fears.\n\n**Hamare Darr (fears)**\n\nAapne yeh scene kaafi baar dekha hoga. Shayad aapke saath bhi hua ho. Ek bacha sadak pe ek street dog ko haath lagana chahata hai lekin mata ya pita bolte hai, mat karo. Mat haath lagao. Kaat lega.\n\nMujhe is jagah pe ek experiment karna bahut aacha lagta hai. Jab bhi mein kissi se milta hoon jisko kutte ya billiyon se dar lagta hai, to mein unse poochta hoon. Aapko yeh dar kyon lagta hai?  10 mein se 2 iska jawaab dete hai ke chote hote unke peechye kutta pad gaya tha, tab se woh darte hai.\n\nLekin sabse zyada logon ka jawab hota hai ke unhein nahin pata. To mein unse thodi aur baat karta hai. Aur mein poochta hu ke kya aapke mata pita mein se kissi ko kutte billiyon se dar lagta hai? To phat jawab aata hai. Haan. Haan meri mummy ko darr lagta hai.\n\nTo aapko dar kyon lagta hai? Sirf isliye kyonki jabb aap chote the to aapki mummy ne apna dar aapko de diya. Aur ab aap apna dar aage apne bachon ko de rahe ho. 100 saal pehle aapki naani ki mummy ko ek kutte ne kata tha, tabse naani ki mummy dar gayi, phir naani dar gayi, phir mummy dar gaye, phir aap dar gaye aur phir agar aapne na roka to aapke bachey bhi dar jayenge. Bina jaane kyon.\n\nYeh sab jaane anjaane mein ho jaata hai. Kuch kutte billiyon ke liye, kuch bahar khelne jaane ke liye, kuch spiders ke liye, chipkaliyon ke liye. Hum apna dar apne bachon ko pass kar dete hai.\n\n**Kabhi kabhi hum kissi cheez se nahin darte lekin hum bachon ko dara dete hai.**\n\nJaise andhere se. Hum bolte hai raat ko ke so jao varna light band kar doonga, bhoot aa jayega. Chote bachon ke man pe is baat ka asar padta hai, aur woh shayad zindagi bhar ke liye andhere se darr jaata hai. Bachey ko 10 min jaldi sulane ke liye yeh bahut bada moolya hai. Yeh bachpan ke darr bewajah hote hai aur inhe nikalne mein samay lag jaata hai.\n\n**Fears yaani darr khali parents se nahin aate.** TV ek aur madhayam hai jahan se dar aa sakta hai.  TV par bachey ne koi movie dekhi jismein police kissi ko maar rahi hai to bacha police se dar sakta hai. Thode saal pehle tak mein khud police se darta tha. Agar traffic police waale ne mujhe rukne ka ishara kiya to mere haath pair thoda thoda kaampne lag jaate the. Thoda pasina aane lagta tha. Iss darr ko poora hatane ke liye mujhe kaafi mehnat karni padi. Mind ko re-train karna pada.\n\nFears hona, darr hona normal hai.\n\nMujhe, aapko aur lag bhag sab logon ko kissi na kissi cheez ka fear hota hai.\n\nDar ek emotion hai. Ek feeling hai jo humare mein isliye hai kyonki yeh humein surive karne mein madad karti hai. Humein dar lagta hai jab hamara brain kissi cheez ko khatarnaak percieve karta hai. Hamare brain mein ek part hai jiska naam hai amygdala - woh humein signal deta hai ke dar jao. Agar humnein dhuaan smell kiya to woh signal aata hai ke dar jao. Phir jo hamara ek aur part hai brain ka jisse 'hippocampus' kehte hai, woh reality ko analyze karta hai - ke yeh smell kahan se aa rahi hai, kya koi badi aag lagi hai ya kissi ne bass cigratte fainki hai.\n\nChote bachon mein yeh sab parts fully develop nahin hue hote. Isliye bachon ko mushkil hoti hai samajne mein ke kaunse khatre asli hai aur kaunse nahin. Yahan hum bachon ki madad kar sakte hai.\n\nPehli madad to yehi hai ke hum unmein kissi bhi wajah ka darr khud se na daalein – kutte ka, billi ka, police ka, andhere ka.\n\nAur agar koi darr hai to yeh teen tareeke hai jisse hum unki madad kar sakte hai dar ke aage jaane mein\n\n- **Sabse pehla step hai ke hum bachey ko khud se solution dhoondne de.** Kaafi baar bachey yeh kar lete hia. Isse 'self regulation' skill kehte hai. Agar jaan ka khatra nahin hai to humein fatafat bhagna nahin chahiye madad karne ke liye. Thoda intezaar karke hum dekh sakte hai ke shayad bacha khud hi aage nikal jaye. Yeh life skill hai. Kyonki hamesha koi aur nahin hoga madad karne ke liye isliye yeh jitni jaldi bachey mein aaye utna aacha\n- **Ab agar aisa hai ke bacha humein apne darr ke baare mein bata raha hai. To hum kya karein?** Agar bachey ne humein apne darr ke baare mein bataya aur humne kahan arey isme darne ki kya baat hai. Ya hum hasne lage. Ya kaha ke aisa kuch nahin hota. To humnein bache ke darr ko nazarandaaz kar diya. We ignored it. Chahe hamein na lage lekin bachon ke liye darr asli hota hai. Yeh kehne ki jagah ke darne ki koi baat nahin hai hum bachey ki baat thoda aur sun sakte hai. **Yeh hamara doosra step hai. Bachey ke baat sunna.** Ismein imp baat yeh hai ke hum darr ko aur bhadawa na dein. Aur uspe lambi baat cheet na karne baith jaayein. Usse bhi bachey ko lag sakta hai ke uska darr sahi tha. Humein utni hi baat karni hai jisse humein darr ke baare mein aur samaj aa jaye.\n\nAgar bachey ko ek movie dekhne ke baad dar lag gaya hai to hum bachey se pooch sakte hai: kya aapko movie dekh ke dar laga gaya. Kya aapko lagta hai ke yeh jo hua woh aapke saath ho sakta hai? Yeh hum darr ko samaj rahe hai, badhava nahin de rahe.\n\n- **Ab hum dar samaj chuke hai to ab humko simple plan banana hai jo hum bachey ke saath implement kar sakein.** Agar bachey ko kutton se darr hai to hum pehle kissi chote friendly kutta jo ke bandha hua hia, usse shuru karenge. Uske pass baithenge, phir touch karenge. Dheere dheere kadam kadam aage badhenge. Aise humein chota clear plan bana ke bachey ko dar se jitana hai.\n\nYeh sabb zaroori hai kyonki darr ke saath jeene ka kya matlab hai?\n\nHum apna koi dar bachon ki na de. Apne bachon ke kissi bhi dar ko badhawa na dein. Apne bachon ke dar ko samjhein. Hamare bachey nidar ho, kissi bhi cheez ka confidence ke saath saamna kar sakein, yeh hum in choti choti baaton se ensure kar sakte hai. Sunikishit kar sakte hai.\n\nAur sabse badhiya to yeh ho ke ulta ho sakta hai. Ho sakta hai ke aapka bacha kutte billiyon se khelne lag jaye aur aapko bhi aapke dar se chutkara dila de.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye paanch min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon. Phir milenge.\n\nPichley episode mein humne andhere se dara ke sulane ki baat ki thi. Humne baat ki thi ke dar agar bachey mein bass jaye to usko nikalna kitna mushkil ho sakta hai,\n\nSulane ke liye ek simple or behtar tareeka routine hai. Ek samay be bedroom mein jaana, takiya lagana, chadder rakhna, light dim karna, ek do teen chaar kitabein padna aur phir good night bol kar sona. Agar hum ek routine follow karenge to bacha bhi uss se used to ho jayega aur humein andhere ke bhai ki zaroorat nahin padegi.\n\nKhud se lambi baat karni padi. Maine socha ke aisa kyon hai aur mein isko hatane ke liye kya kar sakta hoon. Ke agar maine kuch galat kiya nahin hai to mujhe kiss baat ka darr aur agar kiya bhi hai to kya zyada se zyada challaan ho jayega. Yeh poori cheezein ant tak sochne se, saare ke saare results ko sochne se mera dar poora chala gaya.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cs8eBtFI6iZ/",
    "Question: Hamare Darr | How to manage child’s fears?\nAnswer: Jabb meri beti 2 saal ki thi to hum ek play area type jagah mein gaye. Choti si jagah thi, 10-15 bachey khel rahe the. Wahan pe ek plastic ki slide thi. 1-2 feet oonchi. Rang birangi si, 2-3 steps hote hai jis pe. Sab bachey woh slide kar rahe the. \n\nBachey sab 2-3 saal ki umar ke hi the. To meri beti ne bhi play area mein khelna shuru kiya. Ek baar slide kiya aur phir waapis bachon ki line mein lag gayi. Is baar lekin woh slide pe chad ke baith gayi, neechey nahin jaa rahi. Wahan se baith kar idher udher dekhne lagi. \n\nSab chote bachey the. Ab peechey ke bache thoda rone lage. Uoooo aann hone laga. To mein baitha raha. Phir ek do min mein sab parents dekhne lage ke yeh kiska bacha hai. \n\nTo maine Diya ko bola ‘beta slide karo’\n\nNo dadda \n\nBeta slide karo\n\nNo dadda\n\nAb sab dekh rahe the. To mujhe sharam aa gayi aur maine usko utha liya. Woh zor zor se rone lagi. To mujhe aur sharam aayi ke mera bacha aisa hai. \n\nAur mein usko utha ke room se bahar le gaya. \n\nTo kya hua yahan pe? \n\nAap ek curious parent hai. Aur agle paanch minute hum parents ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nTo chaliye ek baar phir se dekhte hai ke kya hua.\n\nSharam kisko aayi? Mujhe. \n\nKyon?\n\nKyonki mujhe laga ke wahan jo parents hai woh mujhe judge kar rahe hai honge. Mere bachey aur mere baare mein kya soch rahe honge. \n\nBachon ko chor diya hota to kuch figure out kar hi liya hota. Kissi ne thoda sa dhaka diya hota, ya thodi der mein khud se slide ho gayi hoti. Ho jaata kuch na kuch. \n\nTo meri beti ko zabardasti wahan se uthana was not actually about her. Yeh uske baare mein nahin tha. \n\nIsliye kyonki humein lagta hai ke hum bachon ke behaviour ko react karte hia. \n\nPar sach to yeh hai ke humara reaction to hamari khud ke feelings ko hota hai. Woh feelings which come up inside us when we see the behaviour of the child. \n\nKyonki jab hum yeh realize karte hai ke our reaction is to our own feelings, we know that this is actually about us, the parent, and not about the child. Hamara reaction hamare baare mein hai. \n\nHamara bachpan kaisa raha, humne aaj tak kya seekha, hamare kya dar hai yeh sab bahar aa rahe hai bachey ke action ke karan. Aur hamara reaction hamari feelings ko lekar hai. \n\nYeh response bache ke baare mein nahin hai. Yeh hamare baare mein hai. Ke hamare ander yeh feeling aa rahi hai ke baaki log mere bachey ke baare mein kya soch rahe honge.\n\nAise bahut saare example hai jisse yeh baat clear ho sakti hai.\n\nMaan lijiye aapka ladka hai, lekin ladkiyon ke kapre pehanna chahata hai. Aap bolte ho - arey yeh kya kar rahe ho. Log kya bolenge. Aisa kaise. Yeh bachey ke baare mein nahin hai. Hamare baare mein hai. \n\nHum apne bachon ke behaviour ko respond nahin karte. Hum us behaviour se hamare ander jo feeling generate hoti hai usko respond karte hai. \n\nBachon ko pata hona ke that we are comfortable with who they are zaroori hai. Lekin uske liye pehle humein khud se comfortable hona padega. Apni ander aa rahi feelings se comfortable hona padega. Khud ko jaan-na padega. Aur khud ko sahi se jaan-ne mein bachey hamari madad kar karte hai. Isliye bachon ke saath rehke mein to khud ke baare mein bahut seekhta hoon.\n\nAgli baar bachey ko kuch karte dekh kar aapke ander koi feeling aaye to aap bhi react karne se pehle thoda ruk kar sochiye. Khud ko jaaniye. \n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye 5 min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon. Phir milenge.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsqcCUoISbS/",
    "Question: Sabse zaroori baat | What is the one thing that every parent should know\nAnswer: Mera naam Harpreet hai. Aur hum agle 5 min bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nGaltiyon ki baat aayi to mujhe google maps ki yaad aagayi. Kabhi aapne notice kiya ho ke kaise google maps kabhi aap pe chillata nahin hai, ya ninda nahin karta. Kabhi nahin kehta arey bewakoof, daayein jaana tha peechye se. Ab tumhein lamba rasta lena padega. Aur time bhi zyada lagega. Theek se suna karo, jo mein bata rahi hoti hoon.\n\nAgar google maps aisa karta to mein to istemaal karna pakka chor deta. To agar daayein jaana choot jaye to google map bass khali manzil tak pahunchne ka naya rasta aapko dikha deta hai, bina kuch sunaye. Google Maps ne to samaj liya hai ke uska maksad humko kharaab lagwana nahin hai, uska maksad hai hamari madad karna, hamari manzil tak pahunchene mein.\n\nTo ab bachon pe aayein to 'Agar galti ho jaye to hamara maksad kya hai? Usko daant kar niraaash karna nahin. Hamara maksad hai bachey ki madad karna. Taaki woh behtar bane.\n\nBahut galtiyaan khud se hi theek ho jaati hai. Ek bacha jab chalna seekhta hai to pehle dagmagata rehta hai. Tab hum uski galtiyaan nahin nikalte. Kyonki humein vishwas hai ke woh khud se chalna seekh jayega. Hum usko sahara dete hai, support dete hai. Taaki woh behtar bane. Taaki woh aur jaldi chalna seekhe.\n\nHum bachey ko nahin bolte - arey yeh kya tumhein chalna nahin aata, baith jao, ruko mein dikhaata hoon kaise karte hai? Hum usko chalte dete hai, girne dete hai. Uska aatm vishwaas badne dete hai. Usko sahara dete hai. Uski aur mustarate hai. To bacha aur mehnat karta hai, aur chalte ki koshish karta hai. Aur chalna seekh jaata hai.\n\nAb bacha thoda bada ho gaya hai aur maths mein galti kar raha hai. Ab yahan pe maata pita zara gusse hone lagte hai. Ya kehne lagte hai arey tumhein itni se cheez samaj mein nahin aati? Ruko mein batata hoon. Yahan pe humein sochna hai. Ke jo raviya humne apnaya tha jab bacha chalna seekh raha tha, kya hum wohi raviya, wohi dhairya yahan bhi rakh sakte hai?\n\nYeh zindagi ka sach hai ke 'sab galtiyaan karte hai'. To agar sab galtiyaan karte hi hai to phir galtiyon ki taraf humein dosti ki bhaavna aani chahiye. Kyonki galtiyaan to hamari zindagi bhar ki saathi hai. Yeh to hoti rahengi. Galtiyan hone ka ek udheshaya hai, ek reason hai. Humko sikhana. To unse pyaar se hi nipat liya jaye to behtar hai.\n\nKhud ki galtiyaan pakadna aur sudhaarna ek zaroore kaushal hai jo ke har bachey mein hota hai. Bacha khud se chalna seekhta hai, khud se bolna seekhta hai.\n\nLekin hamare school kuch is tarah ke hai ke teacher ka main kaam hai galtiyaan pakadna. Isliye bachey khud se galtiyaan sudhaarne ka kaushal dheere dheere kho baithete hai. Kyonki galtiyaan ki to teacher pakad hi legi.\n\nLekin hum ghar par galtiyaan pakadne aur sudharne waale kaushal ko zinda rakh sakte hai. Is kaushal se bachon mein bahut aatm vishwaas aata hai. Ke mein khud kar sakta hoon.\n\nGaltiyaan humein apne bachon se door karti hai, lekin pyaar se kiya hua galtiyon ka sudhaar humein bachon ke aur kareeb laa sakta hai.\n\nBache ke mann mein yeh nahin jaana chahiye - ke mujhe koi galtiyaan nahin karni jeevan mein. Ya galti ho gayi to kya hoga. Yeh hona chahiye ke 'Itna mujhe aata hai, mein kar sakta hoon. Mein galtiyaan kar ke unko theek karne ki sharamta bhi rakhta hoon. Isliye mein kuch bhi seekh sakta hoon'.\n\nKuch bhi kar sakta hoon. Kuch bhi bann sakta hoon.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai.

    "Question: Galtiyon ka Sudhaar | What do adults do when a child makes a mistake?\nAnswer: Mera naam Harpreet hai. Aur hum agle 5 min bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nAgar aapne kabhi bachon pe dhyaan diya hai to aapko lagat hoga ke har bacha alag hai, different hai. Koi zyada shararat karta hai, koi chup chaap rehta hai, koi halka sa haath lagane pe rota hai, har bacha alag hota hai. Is nazariye se dekhne mein yeh sach hai - ke har bacha anokha hota hai.\n\nKissi doosre ke samaan nahin.\n\nLekin mein aapse kehna chahata hoon ke duniya  mein ek hi tarah ka bacha hota hai. Sirf ek tarah ka.\n\nLekin iske baare mein batane se pehle mein aapse poochna chahata hoon ke koi bhi aadmi jisko aap safal maante hai, ke haan inhone ne kuch kiya hai zindagi mein. Unmein kya samaanyata hai. Kya cheez hai jo un sab safal logon mein hoti hai? Sochieye zara.\n\nJo maine dekha hai woh yeh hai ke sab safal log kissi bhi kaam ko poore dhayaan se karte hai. Woh us kaam ko kaafi saalon tak karte rehte hai. Unko woh kaam ko karke khushi milti hai. Thakaavat mehsoos nahin hote. Safal logon ka yeh rahasay aapne dekha hoga.\n\nAb hum waapis aate hai us line par jo maine pehle kahi thi - ke duniya mein ek hi tarah ka bacha hota hai. Jab kissi bhi bachey ko koi aisa kaam mil jaye jo usko interesting lage aur woh usmien kho jaye - tab humein woh bacha dikhta hai. Yeh bacha har bachey ke ander hai. Jiske bhi body, mind development mein koi nukse nahin hai - normal hai. Uske ander yeh bacha chipa hua hai.\n\nParenting ka ek bada lakshya yeh hai - us bachye ko bahar nikalna. OneKindofChild ko dhoondhna.\n\nYeh lakshya paane ke liye humein zyada mehnat karne ki zaroorat nahin. Balki kam mehnat karne ke zaroorat hai. Bachon ko kam rokne ki, kam tokne ki. Uski jigyasa ko zinda rakhne ki, uski khud ke seekhne ke aadat ko barkaraar rakhne ki.\n\nChote bachon ke liye yeh kaam hota hai chalna seekhna ya bolna seekhna. Koi unhein sikhata nahin hai. Aap kitni bhi koshish kar lein ke bacha bolna na seekhey par bacha bolna seekh hi jayega, chalna seekh hi jayega. Aise hi teen saal ki umar ke baad har bachey ko alag alag kaam ki taraf attaraction hota hai.\n\nYeh attraction hum kissi bhi bachey mein bol bol kar nahin laa sakte - keh kar nahin laa sakte ke dhayaan se dekho - yeh khud se aata hai. Kyonki this is needed by our body and mind. Tann aur mann ki zaroorat hai yeh ke bacha koi kaam karne ke taraf aakarshit hota hai.\n\nBachey to cartoon ki taraf bhi attract hote hai, lekin woh useful nahin hai, kyonki usmein hamari body, hamare haath, hamara dimaag use nahin ho raha. Humein chahiye apne haath se kiya hua kaam jismein bachey ka dimaag bhi istemaal ho raha hai.\n\nKabhi bhi agar aap apne bachey ko dekhein kissi cheez pe dhayaan kendrit karte hue to disturb na karein. Uska dhayaan kahin laga hua hai, laga rehne dein. Kabhi aap uske saath bahar sair karne jayein aur bacha kahin ruk ke kissi cheez ko touch kar raha hai, dekh raha hai, use dekhne de. Jaldbaazi na karein.\n\nDhayan kendrit hona hi safalta ki sidi ka pehla kadam hai. Paying attention is the first step to success.\n\nAur yeh har bachey mein possible hai, sambhav hai. Kis cheez mein dhayaan lagega yeh har bachey ke liye different hoga. Aur yeh dhyaan khali woh bacha khud se laga sakta hai. Lekin yeh dhayaan lagane ke liye environment parents, school, teachers, daada daadi, naani naani de sakte hai.\n\nAap apne bachey ko safal dekhna chahate hai, khush dekhna chahate hai. Yeh possible hai. Iska sabse aasaana rasta hai OneKindofChild ke saath. Har bachey ke saath.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai.

    "Question: Ek tarah ka baccha | One kind of child\nAnswer: Mera naam Harpreet hai. Aur hum agle 5 min bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\n**Kaafi logon ko lagta hai ke bachey maarne se sudher jaate hai. Kya hai sach hai?** Hum bhaavnaon par nahin jayenge, ke maarna nahin chahiye, bachey ko takleef hoti hai, dekhne waalon ka kya. Yeh sab bhaavnaayein hai. Hum aankadon ko dekhenge. Uske liye humein sun 1971 mein Sweden jaana padega jahan pe ek pita ne apni 3 saal ke beti ko itna maara ke uski mrityu ho gayi. Aap sochenge ke arey normal log itna nahin maarte to hum iske baat kyon karein.\n\nMein aisa udaharan isliye le raha hoon kyonki aisa example leke cheezein saaf ho jaati hai, theek se dikhti hai. Is durghatna ke karan itna hungama hua ke July 1, 1979 mein Sweden duniya ka pehla desh bana jisne maata pita ka bachon ko maarna ban kar kiya. Interesting baat aati hai ab. Jab yeh hua to bahut logon ne kaha ke bachon ko maarna band kar denge to bache bigad jayenge aur kuch saalon mein crime bad jayega. Lekin aisa kuch nahin hua. Sweden mein crime nahin bade. Aaj 40 saal ho gaye hai aur Sweden mein kam hua hai to sirf youth suicide aur drug usage.\n\n**Hum bachon ko kyon maarte hai?** Shayad aap nahin maarte honge. Lekin bahut log maarte hai. Kyon maarte hai. Sabse samaanay jawab milta hai ke 'bache ne sahitani ki' isliye. Lekin shaitani ki to hum pyaar se bhi samjha sakte the, kuch aur bhi kar sakte the. To phir maarna kyon hai?\n\nMere dimaag mein to do hi kaaran aate hai.\n\n- Pehla karan yeh ke maarne waale ka khud pe niyantran nahin hai aur usne gusse mein ek do laga di. Ab bachey paalna aasaan kaam hona chahiye lekin hai nahin to kabhi kabhi gussa bhi aa jaata hai. Agar aapko lagta hai ke maarna galat hai lekin gusse mein maar dete ho to to aapko khud pe hi dhayaan dena hai. Kyonki iska bache se kuch lena dena nahin.\n- Doosra karan yeh ke maarne waale ko lagta hai ke maarne se bacha sudher jaata hai. maarna zaroori hai. Agar maarenge to jo shaitani bachey ne ki woh band ho jayegi. Bacha sudher jayega.\n\nAb maarne ke karan us ghari mein to shaitani ruk jaati hai. Lekin yeh to dar ke karan hai.\n\nLambey samay mein pitai ka kya asar hota hai? Kya bacha sudherta hai? Ismein hum ikathe baat cheet kar sakte hai.\n\nPichley 50 saalon mein is prashan par bahut research hui hai.\n\nEk research mein unhone 2 tarah ke bachey liye. Ek jinki pitai hoti thi aur ek jitni kabhi pitai nahin hui. Dono bachon ko MRI machine ke saath jora gaya aur unko tasveerein dikhayi gayi: hasti hui photo aur dhamki waali - dono tarah ki. MRI machine jo seedha dimaag ke signal padti hai, use dekh kar research ne yeh saabit kiya ke jin bachon ko maar padti thi, unka brain dhamki waali photo dekh kar bahut zyada active ho gaya. Woh bache chintit hue aur yeh saabit hua ke pitaai ka dimaag par asar hota hai.\n\nEk 1997 ki doosri research jo 6-9 saal ke bachon par ki gayi, usse yeh saabit jo bachon ki pitai hoti thi, unka vayavahaar 2 saal ke baad zyada asamaajik ho jaata hai.\n\nAisi bahut saari research hui.\n\nPhir 2016 mein ek researcher ne 160,000 bachon pe ki gayi 50 saal ki research ikatha kiya. Un sabko jora to usse yeh saabit hota hai ke maarne ke karan bachon mein\n\n- depression\n- unhappiness\n- chinta\n- drugs aur daaru ka istemaal\n\nyeh sab badta hai.\n\nYeh sab cheezein maarne ke karan kyon badti hai uski teen wajah hai jo research ne batayi\n\n- pehli wajah hai maa baap ke rishtey ka pitai ke karan kamzor hona\n- Doosra ek chemical jiska naam cortisol hai uska bache ke shareer mein badna\n- dimaag mein jo hissa humein tension se deal karne mein madad karta hai, uska pitai ke karan kamm hona\n\nTo yeh 50 saal ki research ne jo yeh saabit kiya ke maarne ke nuksaan hai.\n\nAb nuksaan to bata diye, lekin hum to faayde dhoond rahe the. To maarne ke faayde kya hai?\n\nAaj tak poori duniya mein koi bhi research yeh saabit nahin kar paayi hai ke: **maarne ka koi bhi faayda hai.**\n\nPitai karne ka koi bhi long term faayda aaj tak koi bhi research saabit nahin kar paayi hai.\n\nEk videshi author Astrid Lindgren ne ek kahani sunayi thi jo mein aapko sunana chahata hoon. Unko ek budhi aurat ne yeh kahani batayi thi. Woh budhi aurat ne bataya ke jab woh choti thi to unko lagta tha ke maarna bache ko bada karne ka ek zaroori bhagya hai. Ek din uske chote bete ne kuch kiya jiske karan use laga bete ko saza deni chahiye. Lekin chari nahin mil rahi thi. To uske bete ko kaha ke jao chari le kar aao. Bacha kaafi time tak gaya raha aur rote rote waapis aaya. Usne kaha - Ma chari nahin mili lekin yeh pathar mila hai jo aap mujpe faink sakte ho. Woh budhi aurat ne bola ke us samay usne pehle baar is paristhiti ko apne bachey ke nazar se dekha. Aur woh bhi rone lagi. Uska samkha ke bache ko laga hoga ke maa mujhe maarna chahati hai to pathar se hi maar le. Dono mil ke ikathe roye aur ma ne woh pathar rasoi mein rakh liya taaki woh usko hamesha yaar dila sake is cheez ki: ke kuch bhi ho jaaye, kabhi pitai nahin.\n\nJabb bachey ki pitai hoti hai to hum bachey ko kehna chahate hai ke - tumne kuch galat kiya hai, yeh sahi nahin hai. Lekin bachon ko mehsoos hota hai ke mere maa baap mujhse gussa hai aur mujhe pyaar nahin karte. Woh yeh connection nahin kar paate *maar ka aur vyavahaar ka.*\n\nEk prashan jo bahut saare parents poochte hai woh yeh ke, agar maare nahin to kya karein?\n\nIske baare mein bhi baat karenge. Lekin abhi ke liya itna hi.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye paanch min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon.

    "Question: Ek doonga laga ke | Does hitting children work?\nAnswer: Yeh episode isliye ban raha hai kyonki aap mein se ek parent ne yeh sawaal poocha. Ke mere bete ki height choti hai. Mein usko kaise tackle karoon? Kya jawaab doon? Kyonki school mein bache usko pareshaan kar rahe hai. bully kar rahe hai.. Mein motivate karne ki koshish kar raha hoon.  Woh pareshaan hai. To as a parent mein kya kar sakta hoon?\n\nTo maine reply kiya ke actually bachey ki choti height ka isse koi lena dena nahin hai. Almost sab log kabhi na kabhi bully hote hia - koi choti height ke liye, koi pimples ke liye, koi mere jaise lambe baalon ke liye. \n\nMere baal lambe hai, to chote hote Delhi ke mere school mein bachey gaate the - order order order sardar ji ke joore mein 2 kilo powder. Mein tab 8 saal ka tha. Mujhe yaad hai mujhe bura lagta tha. Lekin yeh yaad nahin ke maine ya mere parents ne kaise tackle kiya. \n\nLekin abhi to hum research kar sakte hai. \n\nAap ek curious parent hai. Aur agle paanch minute mein bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nHum baat karenge ke bache bully kyon karte hai aur koi bully ho raha hai to woh kya kar sakta hai. Aur ismein parents ka kya role hai.\n\nMere bachpan ki mujh par hui bullying ka aaj mujhe impact nahin dikhta. Isliye yeh kehna mere liye bahut aasaan hai ke bullying mein kuch karne ki zaroorat nahin hai. Apne aap theek ho jayegi.\n\nLekin research prove karti hai ke yeh sahi nahin hai. Aap kissi ko din raat agar loser bolegeto uska mann maan sakta hai ke woh loser hi hai. \n\nHamare brain ke baare mein adbhut cheez yeh hai ke woh birth ke baad bahut develop hota hai. Humans ki success ka ek bada karan maana jaata hai hamare brain ka paida hone ke baad develop hona. Baaki animals ke saath aisa nahin hai. Hamara brain itna underdeveloped hota hai ke hum chalne mein 12 mahine lagte hai. Hamari personality, IQ in sab ko develop hone mein time lagta hai. Yeh isliye hai kyonki hamari brain ki wiring form hoti hai hamare bachpan ke experiences se, environment se. \n\nLekin is environment mein bullying bhi aati hai jo ke hamare bachon ki wiring ko impact kar sakti hai. \n\nBullying mein 2 characters hia. Ek jo bully kar raha hai aur ek jo bully ho raha hai. Chaliye in dono ko samajte hai. \n\nBache alag alag wajah ke karan bully karte hai. Chaliye aise chaar scenarios ko dekhte hai\n\n- **Ek wajah hai ke bache ne ghar mein kuch notice kiya aur pick kar liya.** Maan lijiye aap koi word jaise bewakoof bahut use karte hai, to bachey ne bhi seekh liya. Maan likjiye ghar mein sardaron par joke chalte hai to bacha bhi school mein chote sardar ko dekh kar automatically joke marega. Is case mein to simple hai humko apna vyavahar badalna hai aur ek baar bachey ko samjhana hai.\n- **Doosra ho sakta hai ke ‘kuch different dekhne ke karan bacha bully kar raha hai’.** Maan lijiye koi ladka pink colour ki pants pehna ke aaya  to ho sakta hai doosre bache bolein - he is weird ya he looks silly. Yeh aacha samay hai bache se baat karne ka ke ‘log different hote hai’, unki choices alag alag ho sakti hai. And humein woh strange sirf isliye lag rahe hai kyonki humne kabhi aisa pehle nahin dekha\n- **Bache kissi ko stupid ya koi aur name calling isliye kar sakte hai to make themselves feel better.** Kyonki woh bully khud insecure feel kar raha hai, left out feel kar raha hai to woh kissi aur ka mazaak udata hai. To is case mein parent/teacher apne bachey ko bata sakte hai ke looks like you are hurt/angry/upset. Are you ok? Aur jab bacha calm down ho jaye to usse baat kar sakta hai ke name calling is not ok.\n- **Finally kayi bache khud bullying start nahin karte par saath mein jur jaate hai.** Taaki woh ek cool group ka part ban sakein. Is case mein as adults hum bache ko bata sakte ha ke friendship ka matlab haan mein haan milana nahin hai. Aur humko woh sab kuch karne ki zaroorat nahin hai jo ke hamare dost kar rahe hai. Aur usko bata sakte hai ke agli baar aisa ho to woh apne doston ko bol sakti hai ke ‘name calling nahin karna chahiye’. She can say it without losing friends.\n\n**Ek example mein lena chahata hoon bache ko correct karne ka.** Maan lijiye aapke bache ne bola - I don’t like Bhagyashree, she’s south Indian. So we can say - ehh kya matlab south indian, what does that mean? But isse bacha defensive ho jayega. Theek kuch nahin hoga, aapke saamne bas bolna chor dega. Par ek doosra tareeka dekhte hai - hmm lagata hai tum south india ke sab logon ko jaanti ho aur tumhein koi bhi aacha nahin lagta. Yeh kaise? Have you met everyone in south india? \n\nKaise kissi ko bina mile hum bata sakte hai hai. Aapko bhagyashree ke saath khelna nahin aacha lagta woh theek hai, lekin mujhe nahin lagta ke south india ka isse koi bhi lena dena hai. \n\n**Ab jo bache bully ho rahe hai un mein se kayi bachon ko bully hone se fark ji nahin padta.** They just don’t care. Kyonki unka khud ka aatmvishwaas itna high hota hai ke koi kuch bhi bole woh andekha kar dete hai. \n\nYeh baat humko har bachey ko samjhani hai. Ke agar koi aapko chotu ya bewakoof bol raha hai to problem us bachey ki hai jo bol raha hai. Us bachey ka confidence khud mein kam hai to woh aapko keh raha hai. Us bachey ne abhi tak seekha hi nahin hai ke bachey different different hote hai - kissi ke lambe baal hote hai, koi gore hota hai, koi kaala hota hai, koi lamba hota hai, koi chota hota hai. Usko pata hi nahin hai. Tum usko bolo ke uski thinking ko theek kare. \n\nBullying rokne ke 2 aur chote aur best tareeke hai\n\n- Pehla bully ko ignore karna. Bachey ko batana ke dekho tum react karna chor do woh 3 din mein kissi aur ko bolne lagega kuch aur.\n- Doosra seedha seedha mana karna. Bachey ko batana ke koi agar aisa bole to strictly bol do - merese aise baat mat karo.\n\nResearch ne prove kiya hai ke agar bachey taiyaar hote hia bully ko respond karne ke liye to unpe kam asar padta hai. \n\nKabhi kabhi mujhe lagta hai ke meri beti bully hai. Aur kissi ko nahin to humko to bully karne ki koshish zaroor karti hai. \n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye 5 min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon.

    "Question: Ehh Chotu Master | Why do children bully and tease?\nAnswer: Aaj se 3 saal pehle meri biwi ne mujhe bola ke tum nikal jao ghar se. Thode din ghoom ke aao. Maine ek company banayi thi 10 saal laga ke, and after we sold it and I had time. To shayad mein ghar ke kaamon mein dakhalandazi kar raha tha to usne bhi sahi bola, ke tum jao. Thode din ghoom ke aao.\n\nMujhe pahar aachey lagte hai to mein Himachal chala gaya. Wahan pahuncha to mujhe yaad ke mere batchmate hai jo ke yahan kahin aas paas rehte hai. Rajat aur Madhumita. Mein unhein 15 saal se nahin mila tha. To maine call kiya aur poocha. To unhone bole arey ghar aa jao.\n\nWoh log Palampur mein reh rahe the. Jab ghar gaya to pehli baat meri mulakat unke bete Joy se hui. Joy tab I think 3.5 ya 4 saal ka tha.\n\nGhar mein har jagah dinosaur hi dinosaur the. Deewaron pe cuttings lagi hui thi dinosaurs ki. Joy baith kar ke dinosaurs colour kar raha tha aur phir dinosaurs ko scissors se kaat raha tha. Ek do ghante woh bass yehi karta raha.\n\nKoi aur bacha bhi nahin tha aas paas par woh mummy mummy papa papa nahin laga hua tha. Apne kaam mein magan tha.\n\nHum 15 saal baad mil rahe the. Maine Rajat aur Madhumita se baat ki to pata laga ke unhone job ki, company chalayi aur last mein woh dono teacher bhi the Rishi Valley school mein. Phir sab kuch chor ke paharon mein rehne aa gaye. Par kyonki teacher the to basic cheezein kya seekhani hai yeh unhein pata tha.\n\nLekin usse important cheez jo unhein pata thi woh yeh ke bachey ko force karke padai nahin karwa sakte. Uske interest se karwa sakte hai. Joy ka interest by chance dinosaurs mein tha. To dinosaurs ko use karke hi poori padayi chal rahi thi.\n\nJoy dinosaurs ko draw karta tha, phir colour karta tha, phir kaat-ta tha, diwaar pe chipkata tha.  Phir papa mummy se dinosaurs ke baare mein aur poochta tha, unke naam likhta tha. Yeh sab chal raha tha.\n\nJoy ne c a t cat likhne se pehle velociraptor and t-rex likhna seekha.\n\nJab maine Joy se baat ki to usko ek ek dinosaur ke naam pata the.  Paani mein rehta hai ke zameen par, kahan paaya jaata tha, sab pata tha. .\n\nMaine usse poocha ke yeh batao dinosaur khata kya hai. To woh confuse sa ho gaya. Mujhe laga shayad sawal samaj mein nahin aaya - phir usne dheere se poocha - herbivore ya carnivore. Matlab vegetarian dinosaur ke baare mein pooch rahe ho ya non veg waale ke baare mein.\n\nColouring, cutting, drawing, english alphabets yeh sab maa baap ke liye padai thi lekin Joy ke hissab se woh khel tha, padai to bass saath saath mein ho rahi thi.\n\nUs din ke baad hum touch mein rahe, aur kaafi baar mile.\n\nJoy ab 6.5 saal ka ho gaya hai. Abhi bhi school nahin jaata. Actually din mein 5 ghate Table tennis ki ek academy jaata hai. 3 ghante subah and 2 ghanta dupeher mein. Kyonki uska interest hai table tennis mein to Rajat ne ghar par ek table tennis ka table aur gend phenkne waali machine laga di hai.\n\nAaj subah hi meri unse baat hui. Aur woh bata rahe the ke unhone ek chota system banaya hai ghar mein ke agar koi book padenge to uska summary likhenge. Isliye Joy likh raha hai. Aur agar Ma se poochta hai aur koi improvement hoti hai, to poora page baith ke waapis likh deta hai, bina kissi ke kahe.\n\nUska cousin brother ki 5th class ke maths sheet hai, Joy ne dekh li to baith ke solve karne laga. Kyonki kissi ka external dabaav nahin hai. Karne ki prerna ander se hai.\n\nPadai abhi bhi full chalu hai. Bass Joy ko abhi bhi nahin lagta ke woh padai hai.\n\nMere ek dost book publishing industry mein hai. Wahan ke expert maane jaate hai. Woh bata rahe the ke chote bachey kitaabein khud se padna shuru karte hai, lekin 4th 5th class ke baad yeh aadat choot jaati hai. Kabhi kabhi zindagi bhar ke liye. Iska main reason hai kyonki is umar ke baad school ki padai forcefully hone lagti hai.\n\nSubject pasand ho ya na ho. Padna padega.\n\nIsliye bachey jo khushi khushi se padte the woh bhi extra books padna chor dete hai.\n\nJo Madhumita aur Rajat kar rahe hai woh aasaan nahin hai. Bachon se khel khel mein padai karwana mushkil kaam hai, skilled kaam hai.\n\nMere liye is sab mein sabse badi learning yeh thi ke padai aur khel mein actually koi difference nahin hai. Yeh difference hum bana dete hai, humare school bana dete hai. Kyonki line mein bitha kar bachon ko dar se padana aasaan hai. Ek class mein kisski ko dinosaur pasand hai, kissi ko billiyaan, kissi ko tiger to teacher bhi kya kare. Aise skilled teacher bhi kam hai.\n\nLekin as parents hum yeh samaj sakte hai ki forcefully ki hui kissi bhi cheez ka lambey samein mein faayda nahin hai. Aur Khel khel mein bachon ke saath ki hui cheez mein maze bhi hai aur faaydey bhi.\n\nHamara bachon ko bolna ke khelne nahin jaoge jab tak 2 page nahin likhoge se aaj shayad do page likhein jayein kyonki bachon ko khelna pasand hai.\n\nLekin bachon ko likhne se thodi nafrat pakka ho jayegi aur lambey samein mein shayad bacha writing karne se katrayega.\n\nLekin woh 2 page agar aise topic pe ho jismein bachon ko interest ho to shayad woh 2 page woh khud se hi likh dega, kya pata 4 likh de.\n\nSeekne ki jigyasa har bachey mein hoti hai. Lekin usko use kar ke bachon ko padana parents aur teachers ke haath mein hai.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye 5 min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon.\n\nImp baat yeh hai ke kutte billi ya crocodile ya cars ki cuttings nahin kar rahe the. Woh kar rahe hote to bachey ko kaam lagta, ke mere se karwaya jaa raha hai. Abhi Joy yeh khud kar raha tha. Apne mann se.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrP7HFmPOz2/",
    "Question: Bina school ke padhayi | How to make kids learn joyfully?\nAnswer: Mera naam Harpreet hai. Aur hum agle 5 min 'ddd' bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nAap kaam kar rahe the aur aapka bacha bhi busy tha. Aapkey bachey ne aapke liye ek drink banayi. Thoda pani liya, usmein namak daala, phir cheeni daali, phir haldi bhi daal di. Phir chamach se ghumaya to paani idher udher bhi gir gaya. Phir woh drink ek glass mein lete aapke pass aaya. Smile kiya aur bola papa yeh piyo. Aapne mana kar diya, lekin bachey ne bola piyo piyo. Aapne ek ghooth piya aur dekha yeh to bahut kadwa hai. Aap kitchen ki taraf bhage normal paani pine ke liye aur dekha wahan haldi, paani, cheeni, namak sabb faila hua hai.\n\nAapka paara poora bad gaya. Aur aap bachey par chila diye.\n\nAisi ghatna, aisa kuch scenario har ghar mein hota hai. Kabhi kabhi har roz hota hai. Bachey shararti hote hai. Masti karte hai. Galtiyaan karte hai. To humein kya karna chahiye? Aur hamare is samay chilane ka bachon par kya asar hota hai?\n\nChaliey isko samajte hai. Is poore nazariye ko bachon ki nazar se dekhte hai.\n\nBachey ne dekha aap busy hai. Khelne ke liye koi nahin hai. Ya woh bore ho raha tha. Usne socha kuch naya karte hai. Mummy papa mujhe har roz dhoodh pilate hai, aaj mein bhi kuch bana ke pilata hoon unko. To usne glass aur paani liya. Thoda paani gir gaya, lekin bachey ko uski fikar nahin hai, kyonki woh kuch banane mein magan hai. Sugar sabko aacha lagta hai, namak bhi. Usne dono daal diye paani mein. Shayad usne khhud se usko chakh karke bhi dekha.\n\nPehli baar usne samjha ke cheeni aur namak dono paani mein milane pe kya hota hai. Woh ghulte hai kya? Kitni cheeni ghul jaati hai, kitni reh jaati hai. Arey namak to gayab hi ho gaya jaldi, yeh sab usne khud se seekha.\n\nTabhi uski nazar haldi ke colour par padi. Usko laga arey yeh milaoonga to koi aachey rang ki drink ban jayegi. Usne shayad zindagi mein kabhi bhi haldi nahin chakhi hai. Aaj pehli baar chutki ya poora chamach le ke daal diya. Aur dekha ke kaise ghul raha hai, kaise chamach se ghumane se haldi ke daane bhi ghoom rahe hai. Shayad waapis taste kiya aur apni jeebh bahar nikali kyonki yeh to peene layak hi nahin hai. Ab usko duniya mein apne sabse payare logon ki yaad aayi, uske mata pita. Aur usne socha ke chalo unko pilata hoon, khoob maza aayega, masti aayegi. Aur aasha se, sab jo kachra kiya tha kitchen mein, woh bhool ke woh apne sabse priyey logon ke paas aaya. Aage kya hua yeh to aapko pata hi hai.\n\nAgar humein use daanta, gussa kiya to kya galat kiya?\n\nBachpan mein bachon ke pass hota hi kya hai. Curiosity matlab jigyasa hi to hoti hai.\n\nYeh jigayasa hi hai jisne maaanav ko yahan tak pahuchaya hai.\n\nJigyasa se hi aavishkaar hote hai, duniya aage badti hai.\n\nJiske paas jigyasa hai, uske koi din khali nahin jaata, woh hamesha seekhna chahata hai. Aage badna chahta hai.\n\nAur gussa kar ke humne us jigyasa parr thanda paani daal diya. Bacha seekha ke jigayasa se zyada mahatavpooran hai saaf ghar. Mein kone mein baitha rahoon woh theek hai lekin ghar ganda nahin hona chahiye. Hamare school bhi kaafi time yehi karte hai. Sawaal poochne ke yogyata ko dabate hai. Humne ghar parr bhi daba di.\n\nAapke dimaag mein jo sawaal chal raha hai woh sahi hai.\n\nKe iska kya matlab hai. Ghar kitna bhi ganda karnein de. Jo chahe woh karne de. Bilkul nahin. To phir kya karein?\n\nIs paristhiti mein hum bahut hi simple kaam kar sakte hai. Hum bachey ko bol sakte hai, arey aacha hai tumne experiment kiya. Agli baar kuch different drink laana, yeh to mujhe aachi nahin lagi.\n\nLekin yeh dekho kitna kuch idher udher gira hua hai. Chalo isko ikathe mil kar saaf kar dete hai. Yeh karwana zaroori hai. Bacha ab samaj gaya ke mere mata pita ko meri jigyasa mein ruchi hai. Mein try karta rahoonga. Lekin ghar saaf hona bhi zaroori hai varna safai mujhe hi karni padegi. Isliye ab agli baar bacha banate hua paani thoda kam girayega.\n\nDhayaan thoda zyada rakhega. uske haath bhi chote se hai, mann bhi chanchal hai, to jitna rakh paata aaj, usse zyada rakhega kyonki aapne do cheezein ki - usko uski jigyasa pe encouragement diya aur ghar ko saaf rakhne waale niyam ka bhi palan kiya.\n\nYeh sabb hum har situation mein kar sakte hai. Humein bass cheezon ko thoda bachon ke nazar se dekhna hai. Aur jitna hum apne bachey ko zyada samjhege, utna hum yeh har roz kar paayenge.\n\nAur hamara blood pressure bhi kam rahega aur hamara sambandh bhi bachey ke saath gehra hoga.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye paanch min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon. Phir milenge.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq-TstqI3Lj/",
    "Question: Shaitaan Bacche ki Jigyasa | How to manage child’s curiosity?\nAnswer: Mera naam Harpreet hai. Aur aaj hum genius bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nGenius kisko kehte hai? Mujhe to yeh jaan ke aashcharya hua ke genius ki koi vaigyanik pratibhasha nahin hai. To hamare liye ek paribasha bana lete hai. Ke genius bache ka matlab hai ek bacha jismein asadhaaran yogyata ho.\n\nEk sawaal jisko itihaas mein bahut mahatavpooranta di gayi hai woh yeh hai ke: Genius paida hote hai ke banaye jaate hai. Lekin hamare liye yeh sawaal kissi kaam ka nahin hai. Hamare pass to hamara bacha hai aur hum to yeh samajna chahate hai ke uski yogyata ko aasadhaaran banaya jaa sakta hai ke nahin?\n\nTo sabse pehle hum ek aise vayakti ke baare mein baat karte hai jiska naam aapne shayad suna ho. Yeh hai tennis ke mashhoor player Andre Agaasi. Agaasi 8 baar Grand Slam champion reh chuke hai aur Olympics Tennis Gold jeet chuke hai. Aam taur par tennis mein khiladi ek tarah ke maidaan par hi vishwa prasidh hota hai.  Lekin Agaasi duniya ke pehle purush bane jinhone har tarah ke maidaan par - ghaas, clay and hard court, teenon mein Grand Slam tournament jeete. Unke pitaji ne Agaasi ko tennis bachpan se sikhaya. Unhone apne ghar ke peechey khud se tennis court banya. Phir unhone khud se ek machine banayi jo ke teji se tennis gend fainti thi taaki Agaasi practise kar sake. Unhone yeh sharat rakhi ke har roz Agaasi kam se kam 2500 gendon ko khelega.  Pitaji ka maanna tha ke jo ladka choti umar se tennis ki 2500 gend har roz khelega, matlab harr saal chote hone se 10 lakh gend khelega, usko duniya mein koi nahin hara payega. Aur unka kehna sach saabit hua. Agassi world number 1 player bane. **Ab** gaur se suniye. Kyonki mein chowk gaya jab maine unki autobiographjy (unki aatmakatha) padi. Unki aatamkatha shuru hoti hai in lafzon se: I hate tennis. Mujhe tennis se nafrat hai. Agassi ne likha ke kaise unko apne pita ke banayi gend faikne waali machine ek raaksh ki tarah lagti thi. Unko lagta tha ke woh raakshs unko khana chahata hai, woh apni ma ke saath baithna chahate the, kuch aur bhi karna chahate the lekin kar nahin paaye kyonki tennis khelne se fursat hi nahin thi.\n\nAgassi world number 1 bane. Lekin unhone drugs li, apne pitaji se baat karni chor di, unki pehli shaadi tooti. Phir unki world no 141 tak gir gaye. Yeh tab tak chala jab tak unhe tennis se nafrat rahi. Kahin unke safar mein unko bachon ke liye kuch karne ka man kiya. Unhone gareeb bachon ke liye ek school shuru kiya. Us school ko badane ke liye, aise bachon ko aur sahayog karne ke liye unhone tennis is baar dil se khelna shuru kiya. Woh waapis world number 1 bane, is baar lambe samein ke liye. Unhone waapis shaadi ki tennis ki player Steffi Graf ke saath aur unke 2 bache hue jinko unhone tennis mein nahin daala.\n\nYeh kahani see maine yeh seekha ke hum genius bana sakte hai lekin agar hum bachon ko genius banayenge unki marzi ke khilaaf to uske parinaam bhari ho sakte hai.\n\nAb sawaal phir yeh bana ke kya bachon ki marzi se unhein genius banaya jaa sakta hai?\n\nYeh jaanne ke liye chaliye chalte hai milne László Polgár se. Laszlo Hungary desh ke rehne waale hai jo ki Europe mein hai. Unhone apna waqt college mein 400 geniuses ke zindagi ke baare mein padte hue bitaya. Aur yeh kitaabein padne ke baad unhone apne dimaag mein tai kar kiya: ke kissi bhi swasth bachey ko genius banaya jaa sakta hai. Ab woh yahan khali kitabi baaton par nahin ruke. Unhone akhbaar mein ek ishtihaar diya: ke mein shaadi karna chahata hoon. Ek aise biwi dhoond raha hoon jo bhi yeh vishwas rakhti hai ke kissi bhi swasth bachey ko genius banaya jaa sakta hai. Aur mein uske saath genius bachon ko bada karna chahata hoon. Ek Klara naam ke teacher ne unke ishtihaar ka jawaab diya aur un donon ne shaadi kar li. San 1970 mein unhone apna project shuru kiya. Un dono ka yeh maanna tha ke agar bachey ko 3 saal ki umar se padana shuru kiya jaye aur 6 saal ki umar se kissi EK vishesh cheez mein pyaar se padaya jaaye to koi bhi bacha genius ban sakta hai. Unka pehla bacha thi unki beti Zsuzsa. Kiss shetr mein usko genius banaya jaye usmein baare mein unhone bahut socha. Aur finally shatranj ko chuna. Pehli beti Zsuzsa ke baad unki do aur betiyaan hui. Unko bhi shatranj shikhayi. Unki teenon ladkiyaan genius bani. Unko vishv mein Polgar Sisters ke naam se jaana jaata hai. Zsuzsa sabse pehle woman world chess champion bani. Doosri beti Sofia ne Chess Olympics mein gold jeeta. Aur unki sabse choti beti Judith ko aaj tak shatranj mein mahilaon ka sabse badhiya khiladi maana jaata hai. Unhone Magnus Carlson, Kasparav, Anand Vishwanathan aur 8 purush world champions ko haraya hai. Sabse zaroori baat yeh nikli ke yeh teenon ladkiyaan khush thi. Unhone shaadi bhi ki, bachey bhi kiye aur nomal zindagi bhi bitayi. Unki beti Judith ne bola ke chess unke liye ek khel ki tarah rahi. Unhe khlene mein maza aata tha aur woh khelti gayi. Is tarah Laszlo Polgar aur unki patni Klara ne saabit kiya ke genius banaye jaa sakte hai aur khush genius banaye jaa sakte hai.\n\nEk udharahan hamare desh Bharat mein bhi prasidh hai. Aaapne movie Dangal shayad dekhi hogi. Woh movie Haryana ke pehalwan Mahavir Singh Phogat ke parivar ke baare mein hai. Ke kaise unhone apni betiyon mein pehlwaani ki yogyata daali.\n\nJab meri beti paida hui to maine iske baare mein bahut pada aur mujhe itna samaj mein aaya ke agar hum iraade se asadharan yogyata ka bacha paalna chahate hai to uske liye maata pita ko kadi mehnat karni padegi. Itni mehnat karne ka man mera to nahin tha. Shayad aapka ho. To bass itna dhayan rakhiye ke agar aap chahate hai ke bacha yogyata paane ke saath jeevan mein khush bhi rahe to yeh bhi karna hoga ke bache ke mehnat uski marzi se ho rahi ho, dil se ho rahi ho. Jo kar raha ho usko pasand ho.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye 5 min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon. Agar aapko yeh episode mein kahi baat sahi lagi to isse aur parents ke saath share kijiye. Phir milenge.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqsROt1OFU9/",
    "Question: Genius Baccha | How to raise a genius?\nAnswer: Kya bacha music sunne se intelligent ban sakta hai. Bahut saare music classes ki ads bolti hai ke - music sunaniye, sikhaiye. Bacha intelligent banega. Parr kya aisa hota hai?\n\nYeh subject itna popular hai ke US mein ek shaher bachon ke paida hone par unke maata pita ko, parents ko Mozart ki CD deta hai. Mozart ek music composer the 1700’s mein jihone apne 36 years ki life mein 800 classical music composition banayi.\n\nTo kya mozart ka music sun ke bacha Einstein jitna intelligent ban sakta hai?\n\nBachey ke intelligent banne ke effect ko ‘The Mozart Effect’ kehte hai. **“The Mozart Effect”** naam aaya ek research se 1993 mein jismein scientists ne kaha ke Mozart ke gaane sunne se bachey smart bann sakte hai.\n\nYeh itna popular ho gaya ke US mein schools started playing mozart in classes. Georgia naam ki state started giving mozart CD’s to parents of every baby.\n\nAap bachon ko to choriye, research bata rahi thi ke chuhe mozart sun kar puzzles jaldi complete karne lage.\n\nTo yeh actual research thi kya: yeh research thi that college students ke do group banaye gaye and one group heard mozart and the other group were in silence. Then they took a spatial reasoning test. Matlab aisa test jismein images hoti hai. Aur 2D and 3D images ke basis par answer karna hota hai.\n\nThe group jisne mozart suna the, they scored significantly higher.\n\nTo ab yahan tak sun ke lagta hai ke wah: if we do this, our kid will become smarter. Yahan se media ne utha liya aur har jagah bachon ko mozart sunane ke article chapne lage.\n\n**But aage suniye. Imp baat. Jo media bhool gayi.**\n\nKe yeh gains only lasted 10-15 min. Uske baad furrrrr, khatam. There was no gain in intelligence of the subjects. Matlab woh lambey samay tak budhimaan nahin rahe, bass 10-15 min tak hi rahe.\n\nUske 20 saal baad 2013 mein hui Harvard ki research ne yeh prove kiya ke music sunne ka bachon ke intelligence increase karne se koi direct lena dena nahin hai.\n\nAb iska matlab yeh nahin ke music useless hai. Bass yeh ke khali music sunne se intelligent banne ka link nahin hai. But agar music gayein, involve ho ke karein then uske bahut saare benefits hai.\n\nLearning music hamare dimmaag ke neural pathways ko open karta hai, excite karta hai which help us learn better at home and school. Memory, concentration, language processing, discipline sab improve hota hai. Lungs develop hoti hai, life bhar ke liye. And in a playful way. Khel khel mein.\n\nSo bachon ko isliye music nahin sikhana hai taaki woh ‘zyada smart banein’ but isliye music se dosti karni hai so that unko overall development mein faayda ho.\n\nMere case mein sangeet ke research ek chote se incident se shuru hui thi. Meri beti ek chote se Montessory school jaati hai. Ek din jabb woh ghar aayi to ek geet gunguna rahi thi. To hum bhi gungunane lagg gaye. Mein bhi, meri wife bhi, hum sab. Phir humne usko youtube par suna. To woh song tha ‘Planting Seeds of love' by Pam Donkin. Bahut hi sunder geet hai. Iska link description mein hoga. Aap bhi suniye.\n\nLekin usko sunte sunte mere mann mein ek khayaal aaya. Ke yaar mein 40 saal ka ho gaya hoon. Maine kabhi yeh song nahin suna tha. To pata nahin kitne aise songs hai jo maine nahin sune. Aise songs jo sab ko sunne chahiye is duniya mein. Isliye mein music parr research karne laga.\n\n**Research se mein teen sawalon ka jawaab dhoond raha tha.**\n\n- Pehla yeh ke bachon ke liye music ka kya matlab hota hai\n- Doosra ke agar kissi bachey ko music mein interest hai to hum as parents kya kar sakte hai uska utsah badane ke liye. Different umar ke bachon ko kaise music ke baare mein batana ya sikhana chahiye.\n- Aur teesra mein aur gaane dhoondna chahata tha jo ke har bachey aur parents ko sunne chahiye\n\nIsmein pehla sawaal sabse zaroori hai: ke bachon ke liye music ka kya matlab hota hai\n\nAgar woh miss ho gaya to baaki ka faayda kamm hai. Kyonki bacha ek ‘chota adult’ nahin hota. Unka mind, body badon ke fully developed body mind se different hoti hai. Unko cheezein alag tareeke se dikhti hai, mehsoos hoti hai.\n\nEk tareeke se sochiye to music ke case mein bache gaana nahin gaate. Jaise hum bade gaate hai. In some ways: gaana bachon ko gaata hai. They are one with the music. Yeh feeling shayad har bade sangeetkaar ki hoti hogi, lekin har bacha jo khud se ga raha hai, uski bhi yehi feeling hoti hai.\n\nResearch karte karte parents waala khayaal to tha hi - ke mera bacha bhi ek instrument seekh jaye to kitna aacha hoga?\n\nRudold Steiner jo ke waldorf philosophy ke founder hai unka kehna hai ke agar hum instrument dhoond rahe hai kahiye ek 6 saal ke bachey ke liye to aisa instrument chahiye jismein bacha flow ho sake. The child and the instrument are the same. Aur iske liye ek wind instrument best hai.\n\nAur Rudolf kehte hai ke sabse kam aacha instrument hai piano.\n\nPiano easy hai bajana. Kaafi gharon mein aaj kal hote hai aur schools ne bhi bade bade auditorium banaye hai. Lekin for a young child piano might not be the right instrument. Kyonki woh ek memorizing instrument hai, not a instrument with which a child can become one.\n\nJaise counting yaad karte hai waise chote bachey key dabana yaad kar lenge. Lekin shayad usse music aana nahin kehte.\n\nPatricia Campbell jo ke ek bahur hi popular book ‘Songs in their heads: music and it’s meaning in children’ ki author hai, unka kehna hai ke 8-9 saal ke umar takk aate hai bachey apna ek favourite type ka music pick kar lete hai. To usse pehle agar hum unko different music se introduce kare apne musical ghar mein to maza aa sakta hai.\n\nMost cases mein hum khud hi popular bollywood aur hollywood music mein reh jaate hai. Hamare pass choice hai ke 9 saal ki umar tak hamare bachey ko ‘bum digi digi bum’ hi pata ho ya ‘I am me’ by Pete ya ‘Ekla Chalo re’ by Rabindranath Tagore bhi suna ho.\n\nAur agar aapko interest hai ke ek ghar ko musical kaise banaya jaa sakta hai to chaliye agle episode mein iske baare mein thoda detail mein baat karenge: Ke ek musical ghar kaise bana sakte hai!\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqZ7aYuI81w/",

Aur unhone bola ke arey jab bhi hum bahar jaate hai to yeh kissi se baat nahin karta. Ghar pe khelta hai aachey se lekin bahar shy ho jaata hai. Baaki logon ke bachey ikathe khelte hai aur yeh bas side pe khada rehta hai hamare saath. Hum kya karein? Bahut shy hai\n- Dossra counselling session same hi din hua aur ismein 14 saal ke ladke ke maa baap aaye the. Unhone bola ke arey hamara bacha doosron ke saath khelta rehna hai. Jo doston ko karna hai hamesha wohi karne mein laga rehta hai. Aatmvishwas, courage hi nahin hai khud mein. Bass doston ke pichey bhaagta hai.\n\nChote bachey doston ke saath na khele to shy. Aur bade bache ke liye hum chahate hai ke doston ki baaton mein na aaye. Confidence ho khud mein. To matlab agar chote bacha bhi khud se akele mein khush hai, apna khel raha hai to woh bhi courageous hi hua na.\n\nBut label humne laga diya hai. Or shayad confident bachey ko shy bana diya hai.\n\nYeh shy waala kaam khali parents nahin karte. 3 saal pehle hum kahin khane gaye the to meri beti ko pyaas lagi. So I said beta, go get water. Meri beti ne mujhe bola: Dadda I can’t do. I am shy. I asked ke arey how do you know that, kisne bola. She said: my teacher said, she is shy. .\n\nHum ‘shy’ label ko bahut lightly use karte hai. Lekin research mein SHY hota kya hai.\n\nShy bache ka pehla sign 4 months of age pe pakda gaya hai. Ek 4 mahine ka bacha generally nayi cheez, mobile, ya naye toy ko dekh ke khush hota hai, respond karta hai but kuch bache sankat mein aa jate hai, peeth oonchi kar ke rone lagte hai hai. Yeh bachon ko researchers ne jab 10-12 saal follow kiya to woh genuinely shy bache nikle. Jab MRI ki to dikha ke brain mein jo part hai amgydala woh average logon ke same part se zyada respond karta hai.\n\nAur shy and introvert bache mein bhi fark hai. Same nahin hai. Introvert woh hote hai jinko khud ke saath samay bitana pasand hai. Kitaab leke padne lage ya lego tower ghanton tak banate rahe. Unko akela rehna aacha lagta hai. Shy bache woh hai jo ke social interaction karna chahate hai lekin yehi interaction unke liye stress ka karan bhi hai.\n\nAise bache bahut kam hai. Aur most bachon pe yeh laagu nahin hai.\n\nJabb hum apne bachey ko shy keh rahe hai to hum uspe spotlight daal rahe hai jo humein problem lagta hai. Bacha ki caring, sensitive nature, observation power in sabko bhool rahe hai. Yeh bhool rahe hai ke khushi, darr, dukh, joy ki tarah shy hona bhi ek feeling hai, personality nahin. Lekin bache ko hamari baat sunke lagta hai ke woh shy hai.\n\nTo agar aapko lagta hia ke aapka bacha mix nahin ho raha. To pehli baat to yeh ke yeh aapka vichaar hai. Isko bachey ka mat banaiye. Kuch bhi karne ki zaroorat nahin hai. Lift waali auntie aur apne bachey ki taraf bass smile kar lijiye.\n\nDr. Becky ne ek tareeka bataya jo woh use karti hai. She said ke jab bhi unhein lagta hai ke unka bacha shy hai, ya unse chipat ke baitha hai to woh khud se kehti hai: My child is the confident one. Baaki bachon ko dekho. Crowd ko follow kar rahe hai.\n\nHum aisi duniya mein reh rahe hai jahan extrovert hona, zor se baat karna, hello hi karna aachi cheezein maani jaati hai. Aur kamm baat karna reserved rehna thoda negative maana jaane laga hai. Isliye aajkall bachey ko shy bolne se shyness ke saath shame ki feeling bhi jur sakti hai.\n\nAgar baat yahan pahunch gayi hai ke sun sun ke bache ko ab lagta hai ke woh shy hai to bache ki hum madad kar sakte hai. Usko bata ke\n\n- ke uski feeling normal hai\n- ke it’s ok, agar abhi mann nahin hai to mat karo\n\nAur bacha phir bhi bole ke no mamma I am shy to aap bachey se baat kar sakte hai ke\n\n- is it? Mujhe to nahin lagta ke yeh sahi word hai ya\n- usse pooch ke ke shy ka kya matlab hota hai\n- ya usko bata ke ke you are saying you are shy - but mere hisaab se to you are so many things? you are funny, happy\n\nAur khud ko bata ke ke Shyness Courage hai.\n\nShy ek label hai. Mera bacha shararti hai, yeh padta nahin hai, shy hai. Yeh negative labels hai.\n\nPositive lagne waale labels bhi hote hai. ‘Rahul bahut aacha bacha hai. She’s a good girl. Well behaved’. School teacher kehti hai. Inka matlab generally hota hai ke bacha sab sun ke leta hai, waise hi behave karta hai jaise bade chahate hai. Kabhi apne dil ke nahin karta.\n\nJis bachey ko shararti bolenge woh shararti hi banega. Shy waala shy.\n\nLabels ek aasaan tareeka hai jaldi se kuch bolne ka. Lekin dangerous tareeka hai. Negative ho ya positive - bachon pe label lagana bahut aasaan hai. Lekin nikalna mushkil. To inko na use karein to behtar.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai.

    "Question: Bacchon pe label | My child is shy\nAnswer: Aap ek curious parent hai aur agle 5 min hum bachon ke baare mein baat karenge.\n\nAaj kal maine apne 2 doston ke saath subah exercise karni shuru ki hai. Subah 6:30 se 7:30. Jis park mein hum exercise karte hai woh ek school ke saamne hai. Jab subha jaate hai to khali hota hai. Dhayaan se suno to do chaar pakshiyon ki aawaaz bhi aa jaati hai. Lekin jab tak exercise khatam hoti hai aur hum bahar aate hai - sirf gaadiyon ke horn hote hai. Almost har ek gaadi mein ek parent ya ek driver aur ek bacha. Full jaam laga hota hai. \n\nJab bhi mein yeh dekhta hoon to mujhe yaad aati hai apne bachpan ki. Jab mera school 4 km door tha aur mein apni red colour ki cycle par school jaata tha. Akele. \n\nTo mein sochta hoon ke yeh aaj kal bachey cycle par kyon nahin jaate? Kahan gaye woh din?\n\nAaj kal hamare bachey doosrey desh, doosrey shaher to zyada ghoom rahe hai, lekin ghar ke aas pass khud se nahin jaa sakte. \n\nAur kya yeh hum Indian parents ki befassol ki chinta hai ya actually ab cycle par bachey ka school jaana mushkil hai? Baaki deshon mein kya ho raha hai?\n\n**Chaliye kuch research dekhte hai. Research thode saal purani hai, lekin valid hai.**\n\nJanuary 1990 mein ek research paper publish hua. uska naam tha ‘One false move’ matlab ‘ek galat kadam’. Yeh research thi is cheez pe ke pichley 50 saalon mein bachon ki aazaadi kaise badli hai. Aur kyon badli hai? \n\nUnhone bachey ki aazaadi ko naapne ke liye ek term define ki: Children’s Independent Mobility. CIM. CIM ka matlab hai ‘ghar ke aas pass khud se ghoomne ki bachey ki aazaadi’ \n\n**Yeh original research Britain mein hui thi. 70 years ka data le kar. From 1922 to 1990.**\n\nBritain mein transport ministry ne kaha ke is 70 years ke time mein ‘road safety’ increase ho gayi hai. \n\nJab ki number of vehicles on road pehle se 25 guna hai. 25X. But children involved in road accidents have reduced by half. \n\nYeh research paper yeh poochna chahata tha ke **How is that possible?** Ke gadiyaan increase ho gayi hai, speed of vehicles increase ho gaya hai, acceleration increase ho gaya hai. Lekin accidents kamm ho gaye hai? Yeh kaise.\n\nPossible hai. Kaise. Aayiye dekhte hai?\n\n1970’s mein Britain mein saat saal ke 10 mein se 9 bachey, matlab 90% bachey ghar ke saamney ki road khud cross karte the. 1990’s tak aate hai yeh teen mein se 1 ho gaya tha, matlab 33% aur aaj kal 2022 mein aate aate almost 0% ho chuka hai. \n\n1970’s mein United States mein 90% bachey khud se school jaate the. Paidal ya cycle par. But 2000 tak yeh khali 10% reh gaye the. Aur aaj kall yeh bhi shayda zero ho gaya hai. \n\nIndia mein traffic kaisa ho gaya hai, yeh to aapko pata hi hai. \n\nTo hua yeh hai ke traffic kam nahin hua hai. Road safety increase nahin hui hai. \n\n**Road se bachey hi hatt gaye hai.** \n\nIs pe research paper ne bahut hi interesting baat boli: ke bachon ke liye road safety ka sahi measure actually ‘number of accidents ya number of death’ nahin hai. Bachon ke liye road safety ka measure hai: escorting time used of adults for children. \n\nKe bachey ko badon ki kitni zaroorat padti hai. \n\n1971 se 1990 tak yeh time increased by 4X. Chaar guna se bada. Ab aur bad gaya hai.\n\nPehle bachey school khud se jaate the, road khud se cross karte the, ab nahin kar sakte. \n\nMatlab road safety kam hui hai badi nahin hai. \n\nAur parents ki jo chinta hai woh sahi hai.\n\nZyada bachon ke pass cycle hai. Lekin aaj se 20 saal pehle tak cycle ek mode of transport thi bachon ke liye bhi. Aaj kall car chalayi jaati hai aur cycle chalana ghar ke aas pass ek shauk ki tarah reh gaya hai.\n\nJo car humein ghoomane door leke jaa rahi hai wohi car bachon ko thoda bhi door jaane se rok rahi hai. \n\nYeh badalna bachon ki safety ko dhayaan mein rakhte hue, hum parents ke haath mein hai. \n\nAgar aapko zaroori lagta hai ke bacha khel sake kood sake khud se to aap kahan rehte hai usse bahur fark padta hai. Agar aapke haath mein hai choose karna to app yeh do chaar cheezon ka dhyaan rakh sakte hai\n\n- Neechey floor par ghar lijiye, taaki garden jaane tak lift ki zaroorat hi na pade\n- Society mein jo park hai ya khelne ki jagah hai, wahan jaane ke liye road na cross karni padti ho.\n- Ghar se bahar road ke side pe chalne ke liye pavements ho\n- Agar road hai ghar ke bahar to aisa ghar jo ke road end par ho, isse traffic kam hota hai.  Research bolti hai ke aise gharon mein bachon ka independence 40% zyada hota hai.\n\nMein thoda befikar parent hoon. Mera personal tendency rehta hai bachey ko aazaadi dene ka. Lekin yeh sab research padke mujhe yeh samaj mein aaya hai ke ek ek gaadi jo road pe increase ho rahi hai, uska kitna bada risk hai aur impact hai hamare bachon ki freedom pe. \n\nTo agar meri beti ne zid ki ke mujhe road khud se cross karni hai to mein kya kahoonga. Mein us se kahoonga ke mujhe pata hai ke tumko dar nahin lagta. That you are not afraid. But agar tum khud se karna chahati ho to yeh cheez aapko seekhni padegi. \n\n- Ke road park ki hui gadiyon ke beech mein se cross mat karo. Wahan se karo jahan driver tumko dekh paye.\n- Pehle left dekho, phir right dekho, phir left dekho. Agar khali ho to cross karo.\n- Zebra crossing hai to khali wahin se cross karo.\n- Bhaag ke cross mat karo.\n\nYeh simple cheezein mein usko kar ke dikhaoonga saath mein taaki dheere dheere uska aur mera dono ka confidence bade. \n\nKhud se travel kar paane ko personal independence ka sabse bada symbol maana jaata hai. Ke mein khud se kahin jaa sakta hoon. Zyada gadiyon ne aur traffic ne yeh sab badal diya hai. \n\nIsliye apne bachey ko road cross karna sikhana bahut zaroori hai.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai.

    "Question: Ek galat kadam | What do roads and traffic mean for our kids?\nAnswer: Hong Kong mein 90% young adults ko chasma lag chuka hai. They suffer from Myopia. Myopia matlab door ki cheezein theek se nahin dikhti hai – 10 mein se 9 bachon ko.\n\n1950’s mein yeh khali 10 mein se 2 bachon ke saath tha. Ab 10 mein se 9 ko hai.\n\nAur aap agar yeh soch rahe hai ke yeh video mobile aur TV ke karan hai, to nahin hai. Kyonki yeh khali screens ki wajah se nahin ho raha hai.\n\nTo kyon ho raha hai?\n\nAap ek curious parent hai aur agle 5 min hum bachon ke baare mein baat karenge. \n\nAmerica mein ek opthamologist jinka naam Marina Su hai unhone notice karna shuru kiya ke bahut saare bachey aa rahe hai chasma lagane ke liye. Door ki nazar ka. Myopia ka. Headache ho raha hai, theek se dikh nahin raha hai to maa baap la rahe hai. \n\nLekin unhone jo doosri cheez notice ki woh bahut interesting hai: woh yeh ke arey maa baap ke to chashma hai hi nahin.\n\nMarina Su ko padaya gaya tha college ki kitabon mein ke Myopia genetic hota hai. Genetic matlab hamare genes ke karan. Genes ke karan matlab jaise agar mata pita ko diabetes hai to bachey ko bhi ho sakta hai bade ho kar.  \n\nResearch bolti hai ke agar ek parent ko chashma hai to unke bachey ko baaki bachon ke comparison mein double chance hai chashma lagne ka. Agar dono parents ko chashma hai to bachey ko 5 guna, 5 times chance hai chashma lagne ka. \n\nChashme waale parents apne bachon ko le kar to bahut saalon se aa rahe the lekin bina chashme waale bhi kaafi saare parents pichley kuch saalon mein aa rahe hai. \n\nJahan bachon ko mata pita se kam dikh raha hai. \n\nYeh kaise hua? Agar khali genetics hai to phir aisa nahin hona chahiye. \n\nAmerica mein pichley 50 saal mein myopia double ho gaya. Asia ke kayi deshon mein 90% bachon ko chashma lag raha hai. China mein Myopia itna bad gaya hai ke national security concern ban gaya hai, ke military ke liye desh ke 150 crore logon mein se bhi jet fighter pilots nahin mil rahe hai jinko theek se dikhta ho. Estimate yeh hai ke 2050 tak duniya ke 50% logon ko myopia ka chashma lag chuka hoga. \n\nAur bachon ki aakhein khali aisa nahin ke bas thoda pehle kharaab ho rahi hai. Research bata rahi hai ke woh kharaab hone ki speed bhi bad gayi hai. Deteoirate ho rahi hai jaldi. \n\nGenetics ka role hai. Lekin environment aur lifestyle ka role bad gaya hai. \n\nTo yeh khali screens ke karan nahin ho raha hai. \n\nIska real reason hai ke our world is coming nearer. Duniya hamari aakhon ke bahut paas aa gayi hai. \n\nHum log Kothiyon mein rehne se apartment mein shift ho gaye hai. \n\nApartment mein rooms bhi chote ho rahe hai. \n\nScreens mobile hone ke karan aakhon ke nazdeek hai.\n\nSchool jaana jaldi shuru ho raha hai. To bachey kitabein jaldi dekh rahe hai. Writing kar rahe hai. Bachon ke aakhein theek se develop hone se pehle hi. Research kehti hai ke jo bachey garimiyon mein paida ho rahe hai unhein myopia zyada ho raha hai kyonki unki admission school mein jaldi ho jaati hai. \n\nPlaygrounds kam hai aur bachey bahar khelne kam jaa rahe hai. UK mein 5-12 saal ki umar ke 74% bachey din mein ek ghante se kam bahar khelte hai. Isse zyada time to UK mein jail ke prisoners ko milta hai bahar ghoomne ke liye. \n\nAapne dekha hoga ke door ki cheezon ko dekho to aakhoon ko sukoon milta hai. Relaxed feel hota hai. Woh chamatkar samundar ya pahar mein nahin hai, but aakhon ke door dekhne mein hai.\n\nHamari aankh ki muscle hamare shareer ki sabse busy muscle hai.  Duniya pass aane ke karan haari aakhein hamesha focus karne mein lagi rehti hai. Relax nahin hoti. \n\nBachey jab paida hote hai to woh farsighted hote hai. Matlab unhe pass ki cheez theek se nahin dikhti. Kyonki hamari eyeball choti hoti hai. Phir jaise jaise hum bade hote hai, eyeball lambi hone lagti hai. Aur utni hi lambi hoti hai jis se pass aur door dono ka dikhe.\n\nScreens ke saamne, kitabon ke saath indoors bitaya time aakhon ko confuse kar raha hai kyuonki har cheez hamesha focus mein hai. Isliye eyeballs confuse ho jaati hai aur lambi hoti rehti hai. Iske karan door ka dikhna kam ho jaata hai aur bachon ko myopia ho jaata hai. \n\nYeh process irreversible hai. Matlab ek baar ho gaya to waapis theek nahin kar sakte.\n\n \n\nMedicines aa rahi hai jo ke eyeball ko aur badnein se rokti hai. Aise hard lens aa rahe jo ki bachey raat ko pehan ke soyein taaki unki eyeball reshape ho sake. Aur lambi na ho.\n\nTo yahan pe aa ke baat ruki hai. \n\nKe hum aakhon mein chemical aur plastic daal rahe hai bachon ke taaki aakhon ko lagey ke sab kuch theek hai. \n\nSab scientist sehmat hai ke duniya pass aane ke karan bachon ki aakhein kharaab ho rahi hai. Is sab ka ek hi ilaaj aaj tak mila hai. Spending time outdoors. Bahar vakt bitana. Yeh zyada mushkil nahin hai, bass effort ki zaroorat hai. \n\nAgar aap chahate hai ke aapke bache ko chashma na lage to bachon ko nazdeek ki jagah door dikhayiye. Cartoon lambey samey tak mat chalaiye. Bahar khilayiye. Chote hote zaroorat se zyada mat padaiye.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai.

Kyonki hum sab ghar se hi kaam kar rahe the to humne socha ke chalo paharon mein jaa ke k    aam karte hai. Humne Palampur mein, jo ki Himachal mein hai, wahaan par Earth House naam ki jagah book ki. Yeh ek mud house hai, ek choti si nadi ke baadju mein hai, baraf ke pahar dikhte hai yahan se. Par sabse zaroori yeh ke yahan tak car nahin jaati. Car ko 500m pehle rukna padta hai kyonki yeh jagah ek chargah, ek grassland ke beech mein hai. Ped pe ek jhula laga hai aur aas pass bass khuli jagah hai.\n\nYeh jagah humnein, matlab mein, meri wife aur meri beti, humein  1 mahine ke liye book kar di. Aur apne doston ko bola aap bhi aa jao. To ek ek hafte ke liye hamare shahri dost apne bachon ke saath wahan rukne aaye. Humne bahut maze kiye. Din mein nadi mein nahaye aur raat ko taare dekhe. Office ka kaam bhi kiya aur paharon pe bhi chade. Maze ki baat hai yeh: ke har ek dost ki family jo aayi usne ek baat apne bachon ke baare mein khud se boli. Ke yeh kiske bachey hai? Yahan 7 dinon mein yeh gum gaye hai, humein mile hi nahin. Koi mummy mummy papa papa nahin. Koi tantrum nahin. Koi rona dhona nahin. Koi faaltu ki zid nahin. Yeh kiske bache hai?\n\nTab unhein realize hua khud se, ke bachey to wahin hai. Bass vaatavaran badla hai. Environment badal gaya hai. Yehi bachey jo ek 2 bedroom flat mein mummy mummy papa papa karte rehte the yahan aake mummy papa ko bhool gaye hai. Kabhi idher baag rahe hai, kabhi udher. Kabhi pedon se kuch tod rahe hai to kabhi pathron ko jor rahe hai.\n\nYahan Palampur ke mitti ke Earth House mein unko apna asli bache ki jhalak dikhi.\n\nHamare shahar ke ghar sunder hai, TV laga hai, lights lagi hai, yellow, white. Deewarein chamchama rahi hai, floor marble se dhake hai.  Kahin koi kona nahin jahn koi bhi suraakh choot gaya ho. Khidkiyaan band hai. Chipkaliyaan bahar hai. Cheeteeinyaan bhi nahin dikhti. Agar merese poocho to yeh plastic ke khilonon se bhare dead houses hai. Kabhi kabhi cochroach aa jaate hai galti se, to unke liye hum pest control waalon ko bula lete hai. Hamare ghar convinient hai lekin aise ghar mein bachon ko interest karna mushkil hai.\n\nThode mahine pehle maine aur meri wife ne socha ke apni beti ke liye ek bird nest banayein. Shayad koi pakshi aake rahe. Humnein beej khareede, katori mein paani bhara, nest khareeda amazon se, aur apni balcony mein laga diya. Aur phir hum teenon ne intezaar kiya ke koi pakshi aayega. Thode din nikal gaye, humein laga hum kuch galat kar rahe hai. To humein katore mein bhar ke paani bhi rakh diya. Jab kuch dinon tak kuch nahin hua to maine finally ek mitr jo birds ke saath kaam karte hai unhein phone kiya aur poocha: ke hum kya galat kar rahe hai. Usne ek hi sawaal poocha: aap kaunse floor par rehte ho? Maine bola 24th, chaaubeesvein floor par. To uski aawaaz mein thodi se hasi hai aur bola: phir to aapke ghar kaafi cheel hi aa sakti hai. Kyonki koi bhi aur pakshi itna upar nahin udta.\n\nHum mein se bahut saare log aise jagah par rehte hai jahan bachon ko khelne jaane ke liye bhi badon ki zaroorat padti hai. Lift lagi hai ghar ke bahar, khelne ki jagah par gaariyaan chalti hai, park ghar se door hai, cycle chalane ki jagah nahin hai. Isliye bache ke saath hamesha kissi ka rehna zaroori ho gaya hai. Ya ma ka, ya baap ka, ya daada dadi, nana naani ka. Varna aaj kall Nanny ka. Hamare modern gharon mein jismein hum nuclear families ke tarah rehte hai, usmein ek chota bacha khud se kahin jaa nahin sakta, kuch kar nahin sakta. To kar sakta hai to mummy mummy papa papa aur woh woh karta hai.\n\nAb hum sab shaher chor kar paharon mein to nahin jaa sakte. Mera bolne ka yeh maksad bhi nahin hai. Maksad hai to yeh batana ke woh bacha mummy mummy papa papa kyon kar raha hai is umeed mein ke hum us bachey ko samaj payein. Khud pe gussa na ho aur bachon pe gussa na hon.\n\nMein bhi aise hi ek ghar mein rehta hoon. Mumbai mein. 24th floor pe. Humne apni taraf se choti choti cheezein ki hai ghar mein. Ek swing lagwa liya hai, ek rock climbing wall laga li, bahut saare plants meri wife ne ghar mein rakhe hai. Ghar mein meri beti gandagi kar sakti hai, jab tak woh usko saaf karne mein madad bhi kare. Aur kyonki hamare pass samein hai to hum kaafi baar neechey jaate hai khelne koodne ke liye. Jab neechey jaate to jo beti karna chahati usko karne dete, uske pace pe, uski raftaar pe duniya ko dekhne ki koshish karte. Kaafi travel karte hai, koshish karte hai ke aise jagah pe rahe jo prakriti mein ho. Nature mein ho.\n\nKuch din pehle mein apne dost ki 4 saal ke beti ko neechey lobby mein ghumane le gaya. Mera paas samaey tha to socha chalo walk karke aate hai. Hawa chal rahi thi to woh neechey jaate hi kuch udte hue patton ke peechey  gol gol bhaagney lagi. Thoda thak gayi to ek car ke bonnet par chad kar let gayi. 2 min leti rahi, kuch nahin bola. Phir ek dum se chilla ke boli: I can see the Sky. I can see the Sky.\n\nMeri kamna hai ke hamare bachey kahin bhi rahein, din mein khula aasaamaan kaisa dikhta hai aur raat mein taare kaise dikhte hai, yeh kabhi na bhoolein. Yeh hum mata, pita, daada, daadi, naana, naani kar sakte hai. Aur kabhi samay lage to Palampur mein jaa ke Earth House mein rahiye. Apne bina mummy mummy papa papa waale chupe hue bachey ko dekhiye.\n\nMera naam Harpreet hai. Aapne mere saath apne bachon ke liye paanch min bitaye iske liye mein aapka shukrguzaar hoon. Phir milenge.\n\nURL: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpC5vqBo9gK/"
